\section{Task Description}
\subsection{Primary Task}
\label{sect:primary_task}

Our primary task is an emotion detection task on dialogues in the EmotionLines dataset. The dataset is in English and contains TV show scripts and text message dialogues. We need to classify the emotion for each utterance in dialogues.

\subsubsection{Dataset}

EmotionLines \citep{hsu-etal-2018-emotionlines}\footnote{\url{http://doraemon.iis.sinica.edu.tw/emotionlines/index.html}} dataset is an emotion dialogue dataset with emotion labels for each utterance. The dataset contains a total of 29, 245 utterances from 2, 000 dialogues, which are collected from Friends TV scripts and private Facebook messenger dialogues. Each utterance is labeled with one of Ekmanâ€™s six basic emotions plus the neutral emotion.

\citet{hsu-etal-2018-emotionlines} have split the dataset into training, development, and testing set separately. We use the testing set and corresponding gold standard annotation for analysis.

\subsection{Adaptation Task}
\label{sect:adaptation_task}

Our adaptation task is to adapt our emotion detection model to Chinese dialogues in the Multi-party Dialogue Dataset (MPDD). Other dimensions for this task remain the same as the primary task.

\subsubsection{Dataset}

Multi-party Dialogue Dataset (MPDD) \citep{chen-etal-2020-mpdd}\footnote{\url{http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/nlpresource/MPDD}} is a Chinese emotion dialogue dataset with emotion and relation labels for each utterance. The dataset contains a total of 25, 548 utterances from 4, 142 dialogues, which are collected from five TV series scripts from \url{www.juban108.com}. The dialogues have three types of labels: emotion, relation, and target listener. In particular, emotion labels are consistent with those in the Emotionlines dataset.

We will randomly split ten percent of the dataset as the test data for analysis.

\subsection{Evaluation}
Both tasks will be evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

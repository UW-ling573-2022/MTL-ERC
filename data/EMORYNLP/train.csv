"Oh, yeah!",Phoebe,Joyful,1,2
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,Rachel,Powerful,1,3

"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",Ross,Neutral,1,6
"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",Chandler,Mad,1,7
"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.",Rachel,Sad,1,8
....Are we still talking about sex?,Joey,Joyful,1,9
"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",Ross,Scared,2,0

"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.",Ross,Mad,10,12
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.,Carol,Neutral,10,13
"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.",Ross,Powerful,10,14
"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!",Susan,Mad,10,15

Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.

Hi guys!,Phoebe,Joyful,1,0
"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!",#ALL#,Joyful,1,1
"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?",Ross,Joyful,1,2
"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'",Phoebe,Sad,1,3
Ohh. Ouch.,#ALL#,Sad,1,4
"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?",Rachel,Neutral,1,5
"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.",Monica,Neutral,1,6
Since when?,Rachel,Neutral,1,7
"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",Joey,Neutral,1,8
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,Chandler,Neutral,1,9
"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",Phoebe,Mad,1,10
And everybody knows this?,Rachel,Neutral,1,11
Yeah. Cushions the blow.,Joey,Neutral,1,12
"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",Chandler,Neutral,1,13
"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.",Ross,Neutral,1,14
"Uh, Ross.",Monica,Neutral,1,15

"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.""",Joey,Neutral,2,5

"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.",Chandler,Powerful,2,20
"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.",Chandler,Powerful,2,22
Y'miss it?,Joey,Neutral,2,23
"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.",Chandler,Scared,2,24

"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",Rachel,Sad,6,6
"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",Chandler,Joyful,6,7
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,Monica,Scared,6,8
What?,Ross,Neutral,6,9
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",Monica,Neutral,6,10
"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",Rachel,Mad,6,11
"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",Ross,Joyful,6,12
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,Chandler,Joyful,6,13

It's worse than the thumb!,Rachel,Scared,9,9
"Hey, this is so unfair!",Chandler,Neutral,9,10
"Oh, why is it unfair?",Monica,Neutral,9,11
"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",Chandler,Scared,9,12
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,Joey,Sad,9,14
"Well, I-I could live without it.",Rachel,Neutral,9,15
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",Joey,Neutral,9,16
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",Ross,Joyful,9,18
"Oh, ""you do, do you""?",Joey,Joyful,9,19
"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",Ross,Neutral,9,21
"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.",Rachel,Neutral,9,22

"Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!",Paula,Powerful,10,5
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.,Monica,Sad,10,6
"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.",Paula,Powerful,10,7

You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!,Monica,Joyful,7,0
"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?",Rachel,Sad,7,1
You are just like Jack.,Phoebe,Neutral,7,2

"No, Jack and the Beanstalk.",Phoebe,Neutral,7,4
"Ah, the other Jack.",Monica,Neutral,7,5
"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..",Phoebe,Joyful,7,6
"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-",Rachel,Neutral,7,7

Ohhh... I'm fine.,Rachel,Neutral,16,13
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,Monica,Mad,1,0
"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?",Ross,Mad,1,1
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,Rachel,Mad,1,2

"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",Ross,Neutral,4,0
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",Chandler,Neutral,4,1

Where are they? Where are they?,Chandler,Scared,6,0

That's great.,Chandler,Joyful,6,18
"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?",Chandler,Neutral,6,20

Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,Monica,Joyful,10,4
Huh. That's nice.,Angela,Neutral,10,5
"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",Rachel,Powerful,12,0
"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.",Ross,Scared,12,1
What uh-oh?,Rachel,Scared,12,2

"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",Monica,Scared,13,0
Oh my god.,Monica,Scared,13,2

"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",Joey,Peaceful,13,17
"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",Monica,Scared,13,19
"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",Joey,Neutral,13,21
"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.",Chandler,Joyful,14,0
Ow!,Janice,Sad,14,1

Ohhh!!!!,Rachel,Joyful,11,4
"Yes, yes, that's right...",Ross,Neutral,11,5
"Oh, look at the little cat!",Rachel,Peaceful,11,6
What? Ow!,Ross,Scared,11,7
"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...",Joey,Powerful,11,9
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,Monica,Peaceful,12,0
"Sorry, that was wax.",Joey,Neutral,12,2
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",Phoebe,Scared,12,3
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?,Ross,Neutral,12,4
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,Rachel,Scared,12,5
Yeah?,Ross,Neutral,12,6
"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?",Phoebe,Scared,14,0
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.,Rachel,Powerful,14,1
"Er, yeah, it's mine.",Mr.,Mad,14,2
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?,Phoebe,Mad,14,3
"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.",Mr.,Mad,14,4
Wait a minute. What's his name?,Phoebe,Mad,14,5
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.,Mr.,Scared,14,6
Bob Buttons?,Rachel,Powerful,14,7
"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.",Mr.,Peaceful,14,8
Oooh! You are a very bad man!,Phoebe,Mad,14,9
You owe me a cat.,Mr.,Mad,14,10
Lucky sixes....,Ross,Joyful,16,0
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",Rachel,Joyful,16,1
Hi!,Monica,Joyful,16,2
And Joey....,Rachel,Joyful,16,3
Hi!,Monica,Joyful,16,4

Hi!,Monica,Joyful,16,6
He doesn't speak much English.,Rachel,Neutral,16,8
Monopoly!,Paolo,Joyful,16,9
Look at that!,Rachel,Joyful,16,10
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",Ross,Joyful,16,11
"Oh... Italy, I think.",Rachel,Joyful,16,12
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",Ross,Joyful,16,13
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",Rachel,Sad,16,14
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",Ross,Joyful,16,15
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,Phoebe,Powerful,16,17
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",Rachel,Neutral,16,18
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,Phoebe,Neutral,16,19
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",Rachel,Neutral,16,20
You betcha!,Phoebe,Joyful,16,22
"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.",Chandler,Peaceful,17,0
"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.",Chandler,Joyful,17,2
"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.",Chandler,Scared,17,3
Are you alright?,Jill,Scared,17,5
"My God, you're choking! That better?",Jill,Powerful,17,7
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....,Chandler,Neutral,17,8
Perfection?,Jill,Neutral,17,9
"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....",Phoebe,Scared,20,0
Thank you.,Ross,Neutral,20,1
Thanks.,Phoebe,Joyful,20,2
Kinda... spooky without any lights.,Ross,Scared,20,3

"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...",Ross,Joyful,20,6
Oh.. oh... oh.,Ross,Joyful,20,8
"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",Joey,Joyful,20,9
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,Chandler,Joyful,1,0
"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.",Shelley,Joyful,1,1
"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...",Chandler,Sad,1,2
Do you want a date Saturday?,Shelley,Powerful,1,3
Yes please.,Chandler,Joyful,1,4
"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-",Shelley,Peaceful,1,5
He's a he?,Chandler,Mad,1,6
"Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...",Shelley,Scared,1,7
"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",Chandler,Mad,2,0
"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...",Rachel,Neutral,2,1
You did?,Chandler,Neutral,2,2
"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",Rachel,Mad,2,3
"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?",Chandler,Neutral,2,4
I did.,Monica,Neutral,2,5
"Yeah, I think so, yeah.",Phoebe,Neutral,2,6
Not me.,Joey,Neutral,2,7
"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.",Ross,Scared,2,8
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?,Chandler,Neutral,2,9
"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...",Ross,Neutral,2,10
"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",Chandler,Neutral,2,12
"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,13
"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",Chandler,Neutral,2,14
Yeah! Right!,#ALL#,Neutral,2,15
WHAT IS IT?!,Chandler,Mad,2,16
"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.",Monica,Neutral,2,17
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,#ALL#,Peaceful,2,18
"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",Chandler,Mad,2,19
"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.",Monica,Neutral,2,21
"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.",Rachel,Neutral,2,22
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,Ross,Neutral,2,23
"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.",Rachel,Neutral,2,24
"Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",Monica,Neutral,2,25
"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?",Chandler,Neutral,4,0
"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.",Rachel,Mad,4,1
"Yeah, you have homosexual hair.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,2
"So, um, did she...",Rachel,Neutral,4,4
Twice.,Ross,Neutral,4,5
Twice?,Joey,Neutral,4,6
"Oh, that sucks!",Phoebe,Sad,4,7
You guys okay?,Joey,Neutral,4,8
"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...",Ross,Neutral,4,9
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.,Phoebe,Neutral,4,10
"Nono, she's gone.",Ross,Neutral,4,11
We checked. A lot.,Monica,Neutral,4,12
"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.",Phoebe,Sad,4,13
"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?",Rachel,Peaceful,4,14
Thanks!,Phoebe,Joyful,4,15
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.,Rachel,Neutral,4,16
"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",Joey,Neutral,4,17
"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,18
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,Ross,Neutral,5,0
"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",Judy,Joyful,5,1
"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",Judy,Neutral,5,3
I don't see why not.,Ross,Mad,5,4
Here's my retainer!,Ross,Joyful,5,6
I was just thinking. When my time comes-,Ross,Neutral,6,0
Dad!,Monica,Scared,6,1
"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.",Ross,Neutral,6,2
You what?,Monica,Scared,6,3
"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.",Ross,Joyful,6,4
Define fun.,Monica,Neutral,6,5
"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...",Ross,Joyful,6,6
"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.",Monica,Scared,6,7
"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.",Ross,Joyful,6,8
That's probably what they'll say.,Monica,Neutral,6,9
I'd like that.,Ross,Neutral,6,10
"Hey, gorgeous.",Chandler,Joyful,7,0
"Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-",Shelley,Neutral,7,1
"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",Chandler,Joyful,7,2
Oh! Okay! Phew!,Shelley,Joyful,7,3
"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",Chandler,Neutral,7,4
"I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...",Shelley,Neutral,7,5
"...Quality, right, great.",Chandler,Joyful,7,6
"Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.",Shelley,Neutral,7,7
"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?",Chandler,Neutral,7,8
What? He's cute!,Shelley,Joyful,7,9
"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",Chandler,Joyful,7,10
Is Brian...?,Shelley,Neutral,7,11
"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",Chandler,Neutral,7,12
"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.",Shelley,Neutral,7,13
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,Chandler,Neutral,7,14
This one?,Ross,Neutral,8,0
No.,Aunt,Neutral,8,1
"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.",Ross,Joyful,8,2
"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.",Aunt,Joyful,8,3
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.,Judy,Neutral,8,4
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.,Ross,Powerful,8,5
Wait! We need shoes!,Aunt,Powerful,8,6
"Okay. Um, how about these?",Ross,Scared,8,8
That's really a day shoe.,Judy,Neutral,8,9
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?,Ross,Neutral,8,10
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?,Aunt,Neutral,8,11
"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.",Ross,Neutral,8,12
"No, it really should be burgundy.",Aunt,Joyful,8,13
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?,Judy,Neutral,8,14
"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",Ross,Neutral,8,15
Oh my God..,Ross,Mad,8,17
"Is everything all right, dear?",Judy,Scared,8,18
"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.",Ross,Neutral,8,19
"How we doing, you guys ready?",Ross,Joyful,9,0
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,Monica,Mad,9,1
Some days it's all I can think about.,Ross,Neutral,9,2
"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,3
"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?",Rachel,Scared,9,4
What'd I say?,Phoebe,Neutral,9,5
Hm-m.,Rachel,Neutral,9,6
Are these the shoes?,Monica,Neutral,9,7
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.,Rachel,Powerful,9,8
"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?",Ross,Powerful,9,9
Morning. We ready to go?,Joey,Peaceful,9,10
"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?",Chandler,Neutral,9,11
It was a really beautiful service.,Monica,Joyful,10,0
"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.",Judy,Neutral,10,1
What?,Joey,Neutral,10,3
"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.",Chandler,Neutral,10,4
"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.",Joey,Neutral,10,5
You're watching a football game at a funeral?,Chandler,Neutral,10,6
"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.",Joey,Neutral,10,7
"You are a frightening, frightening man.",Chandler,Scared,10,8
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!,Rachel,Mad,10,10
"Oh, I hope they're not ruined.",Ross,Neutral,10,11
"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!",Phoebe,Joyful,10,12
"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-",Ross,Sad,10,13
God! Ross!,#ALL#,Mad,10,14
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...,Ross,Neutral,10,15
"Hey, who's this little naked guy?",Rachel,Scared,12,0
That little naked guy would be me.,Ross,Mad,12,1
"Aww, look at the little thing.",Rachel,Joyful,12,2
"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",Ross,Joyful,12,3
Who are those people?,Chandler,Scared,12,4
Got me.,Ross,Neutral,12,5
"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.",Monica,Joyful,12,6
"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",Rachel,Scared,12,7
"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",Monica,Neutral,12,8
Looks like a fun gang.,Ross,Joyful,12,9
"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!",Joey,Joyful,12,10
"Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.",Ross,Mad,12,11
"Hey, Lowell.",Chandler,Neutral,13,0
"Hey, Chandler.",Lowell,Neutral,13,1
So how's it going there in Financial Services?,Chandler,Neutral,13,2
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?,Lowell,Neutral,13,3
"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.",Chandler,Neutral,13,4
I know. That's what I told her.,Lowell,Neutral,13,5
Really.,Chandler,Neutral,13,6
Yeah.,Lowell,Neutral,13,7
So- you can tell?,Chandler,Neutral,13,8
"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.",Lowell,Neutral,13,9
"So you don't think I have a, a quality?",Chandler,Neutral,13,10
"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.",Lowell,Neutral,13,11
He is?,Chandler,Neutral,13,12
"Yup, and waaay out of your league.",Lowell,Neutral,13,13
"Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.",Chandler,Mad,13,14
"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",Rachel,Peaceful,1,0
An advance?,Terry,Neutral,1,1
"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",Rachel,Neutral,1,2
"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.",Terry,Mad,1,3
"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.",Rachel,Powerful,1,4
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",Ross,Neutral,3,0
"No, she's at a faculty meeting.",Susan,Neutral,3,1
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.",Ross,Neutral,3,2
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",Ross,Neutral,3,3
What's it look like?,Susan,Neutral,3,4
Kinda like a big face without skin.,Ross,Neutral,3,5
"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",Susan,Neutral,3,6
"Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.",Ross,Neutral,3,7
"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",Susan,Joyful,3,8
"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.",Ross,Joyful,3,9
"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",Susan,Neutral,3,10
"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?",Ross,Scared,3,11
"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?",Susan,Neutral,3,12
"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",Ross,Scared,3,13
"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.",Susan,Neutral,3,14
"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",Ross,Neutral,3,15
"Yeah, yeah, all the time.",Susan,Neutral,3,16
Really?,Ross,Neutral,3,17
"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.",Susan,Neutral,3,18
"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",Ross,Neutral,4,0
"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,1
"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",Chandler,Joyful,4,2
"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",Monica,Neutral,4,4
"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",Rachel,Sad,4,5
"Rach, here's your mail.",Monica,Neutral,4,6
"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",Rachel,Neutral,4,7
"No, here's your mail.",Monica,Powerful,4,8
"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",Rachel,Neutral,4,9
Would you just open it?,Monica,Powerful,4,10
"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",Rachel,Joyful,4,12
We all chipped in.,Monica,Joyful,4,13
We did?,Joey,Neutral,4,14
You owe me 20 bucks.,Monica,Neutral,4,15
Thank you. Thank you so much!,Rachel,Joyful,4,16
"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.",Monica,Neutral,4,17
"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",Rachel,Neutral,4,18
"All right, I'm nine years old.",Chandler,Neutral,4,19
"Oh, I hate this story.",Ross,Mad,4,20
"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",Chandler,Sad,4,21
Oh my god.,Rachel,Sad,4,22
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,Chandler,Sad,4,23
"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",Joey,Scared,5,0
We did?,Girl,Scared,5,1
"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?",Joey,Neutral,5,2
"Yeah, right.",Girl,Peaceful,5,3
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.,Joey,Joyful,5,4
Get out.,Girl,Mad,5,5
"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.",Joey,Joyful,5,6
Really? You don't know what that means to me.,Girl,Powerful,5,7
"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?",Joey,Powerful,5,8
Nothing.,Girl,Joyful,5,9
"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?",Joey,Joyful,5,10
Yeah. Oh.,Girl,Neutral,5,11
What's wrong?,Joey,Scared,5,12
"I just remembered, I have to do something.",Girl,Scared,5,13
Oh. What?,Joey,Scared,5,14
"Um, leave.",Girl,Mad,5,15
"Wait, wait, wait!",Joey,Mad,5,16
Anytime you're ready.,Carol,Neutral,9,0
"Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...",Ross,Joyful,9,1
Just aim for the bump.,Carol,Neutral,9,2
"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.",Ross,Scared,9,3
"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.",Carol,Powerful,9,4
"Hello, baby. Hello, hello.",Ross,Neutral,9,5
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.,Rachel,Joyful,10,0
"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",Phoebe,Mad,10,1
"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",Monica,Neutral,10,2
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,Rachel,Neutral,10,3
No I don't.,Monica,Neutral,10,4
"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",Rachel,Neutral,10,5
"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?""",Monica,Mad,10,6
"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".",Rachel,Mad,10,7
Do either of you have the keys?,Chandler,Neutral,10,8
The oven is on.,Monica,Scared,10,9
"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!",Rachel,Scared,10,10
"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.",Joey,Scared,10,11
"Well then get it, get it!",Monica,Mad,10,12
That tone will not make me go any faster.,Joey,Neutral,10,13
Joey!,Monica,Mad,10,14
That one will.,Joey,Neutral,10,15
"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.",Ross,Neutral,11,0
"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.",Carol,Neutral,11,1
"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",Ross,Neutral,11,2
"Hi, how's it goin?",Susan,Neutral,11,4
"Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?",Ross,Joyful,11,5
I did.,Carol,Neutral,11,6
"Does it always, uh--?",Ross,Neutral,11,7
"No, no that was the first.",Carol,Joyful,11,8
Keep singing! Keep singing!,Susan,Joyful,11,9

I felt it!,Susan,Joyful,11,11
"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.",Ross,Joyful,11,12
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,Phoebe,Neutral,1,0
Why?,Monica,Neutral,1,1
"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.",Phoebe,Peaceful,1,2
"Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.",Monica,Joyful,1,3
"Where? Ooh, come to Momma.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,4
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",Monica,Scared,1,5
Nice hat.,Guy,Neutral,1,7
Thanks.,Monica,Joyful,1,8
We should do something. Whistle.,Phoebe,Joyful,1,10
We are not going to whistle.,Monica,Mad,1,11
"Come on, do it.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,12
No!,Monica,Mad,1,13
Do it!,Phoebe,Powerful,1,14
No!,Monica,Mad,1,15
Do it do it do it!,Phoebe,Joyful,1,16
Woo-woo!,Monica,Joyful,1,17
I can't believe you did that!,Phoebe,Joyful,1,19
"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?",Monica,Joyful,2,0
"I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!",Phoebe,Powerful,2,1
"Phoebe, what are you doing?",Monica,Neutral,2,2
Maybe nobody's tried this.,Phoebe,Neutral,2,3
"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.",Monica,Neutral,2,4
"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.",Phoebe,Neutral,2,5

"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",Chandler,Mad,5,0
That's the rule.,Joey,Powerful,5,1
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",Chandler,Mad,5,2
How'd you get to that?,Joey,Scared,5,3
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",Chandler,Mad,5,4
You knew about that?,Joey,Scared,5,5
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.",Chandler,Neutral,5,6

"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?",Joey,Scared,5,19
"Aw, don't do that",Chandler,Sad,5,20

"Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!",Rachel,Joyful,10,9

"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!",Phoebe,Sad,12,4
"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!",Rachel,Sad,12,6
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,Phoebe,Sad,12,7

"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...",Phoebe,Neutral,13,0
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.,Monica,Joyful,13,1
"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.",Ross,Joyful,13,2
"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",Joey,Peaceful,13,3
"Come on, two on one.",Ross,Neutral,13,4
"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!",Chandler,Mad,13,5
"What, now?",Ross,Scared,13,6
"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",Joey,Powerful,13,7
"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!",Chandler,Powerful,13,8

"Rachel, wait, wait.",Chandler,Neutral,1,3
"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!",Rachel,Mad,1,4
Can I just say one thing?,Chandler,Scared,1,5
What? What?!,Rachel,Mad,1,6
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,Chandler,Neutral,1,7

"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",Chandler,Neutral,7,4
"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",Joey,Scared,7,5
"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",Chandler,Mad,7,6
No.,Joey,Neutral,7,7
"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married.""",Chandler,Powerful,7,8

"Hold on, you-you knew?",Joey,Scared,10,4
"Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. ""I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,"" I mean, what is that? Please!",Gloria,Mad,10,5
"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!",Joey,Mad,10,6
"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.",Gloria,Mad,10,7
"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?",Joey,Mad,10,8
"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.",Gloria,Peaceful,10,9
I'm...happy...for you?,Joey,Scared,10,10

"Nothing, nothing.",Phoebe,Sad,11,1
"Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.",Roger,Neutral,11,2
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",Phoebe,Neutral,11,3
Oh. They don't.,Roger,Neutral,11,4
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...,Phoebe,Neutral,11,5

"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",Roger,Neutral,11,10
"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!",Phoebe,Joyful,11,11
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.",Roger,Powerful,11,12

"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?",Rachel,Neutral,4,5
"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.",Monica,Joyful,4,6
"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.",Rachel,Scared,4,7
"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.",Phoebe,Mad,4,8
Hi.,Ross,Scared,6,0
Hey.,Chandler,Neutral,6,1
Where've you been?,Joey,Scared,6,2
At the vet.,Ross,Neutral,6,3
"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",Chandler,Mad,6,4
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,Ross,Neutral,6,5
Hey! He beat ya.,Joey,Joyful,6,6
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",Ross,Neutral,6,7
So what does this mean?,Chandler,Neutral,6,8
I'm gonna have to give him up.,Ross,Sad,6,9
"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",Joey,Mad,7,0
"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?",Chandler,Neutral,7,1
"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.",Ross,Sad,7,2
Isn't there any way you can keep him?,Joey,Neutral,7,3
"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",Ross,Neutral,7,4
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,Joey,Scared,7,5
"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",Chandler,Joyful,7,6
"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",Ross,Neutral,7,7
"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",Chandler,Neutral,7,8
"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",Phoebe,Powerful,7,10
What?,Chandler,Scared,7,11
Did you call the cops?,Joey,Scared,7,12
Nope. We took her to lunch.,Rachel,Neutral,7,13
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,Chandler,Peaceful,7,14
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.,Ross,Mad,7,15
"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.",Monica,Joyful,7,16
"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",Ross,Mad,7,17
...Take off their hats!,Chandler,Joyful,7,18
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,Phoebe,Joyful,7,19
No way. No way did you do this.,Rachel,Scared,8,0
Monana was very brave.,Fake,Powerful,8,1
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,Monica,Joyful,8,2
"So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...",Fake,Joyful,8,3
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,Monica,Mad,8,4
"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.",Rachel,Powerful,8,5
"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.",Fake,Neutral,8,6
'Scuse me?,Monica,Scared,8,7
"There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?",Fake,Neutral,8,8
"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",Monica,Scared,8,9
"Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.",Fake,Neutral,8,10
What?,Monica,Scared,8,11
"Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?",Fake,Neutral,8,12
"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",Monica,Mad,8,13
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?,Fake,Neutral,8,14
Uh-huh.,Monica,Neutral,8,15
"I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.",Fake,Joyful,8,16
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,Monica,Neutral,8,17
"Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.",Ross,Scared,9,0
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,Phoebe,Neutral,9,1
"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",Ross,Sad,9,2
"Oh, somebody will.",Rachel,Peaceful,9,3
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,Joey,Joyful,9,4
You're kidding.,Chandler,Joyful,9,5
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,Joey,Mad,9,6
"Y'know, you'd think I would've.",Chandler,Joyful,9,7
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,Joey,Neutral,9,8
...Flame Boy.,Phoebe,Joyful,9,9
Where exactly is your zoo?,Ross,Neutral,10,0
"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?",Dr.,Neutral,10,1
Yes.,Ross,Neutral,10,2
"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?",Dr.,Scared,10,3
"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",Ross,Neutral,10,4
Even if he were... cornered?,Dr.,Neutral,10,5
"Well I, I don't know. Why?",Ross,Neutral,10,6
"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?",Dr.,Neutral,10,7
"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",Ross,Neutral,10,8
"How about a hammer, or a small blade?",Dr.,Neutral,10,9
Why- why- why would he need a blade?,Ross,Scared,10,10
"Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.",Dr.,Neutral,10,11
"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.",Chandler,Neutral,10,13
"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",Joey,Neutral,10,14
...He's in.,Chandler,Neutral,10,15
"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",Ross,Joyful,10,16
"You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.",Dr.,Neutral,10,17
Yo- hooo!,Monica,Joyful,11,0
Where the hell've you been?,Rachel,Mad,11,1
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.,Monica,Joyful,11,2
Are you drunk?!,Rachel,Mad,11,3
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.,Monica,Joyful,11,4

"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?",Rachel,Scared,11,9
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.,Monica,Joyful,11,10
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",Rachel,Mad,11,11
"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!",Monica,Joyful,11,12
"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.",Rachel,Neutral,11,14
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.,Monica,Joyful,11,15

That I was not expecting.,Fake,Scared,12,5
"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",Monica,Sad,12,6
Oh. Thanks.,Fake,Neutral,12,7
"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!",Monica,Joyful,12,8
"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.",Fake,Neutral,12,9
"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?",Monica,Sad,12,10
"Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?",Fake,Joyful,12,11
"Well, not... worried, just... wondering.",Monica,Sad,12,12
"There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.",Fake,Neutral,12,13
Not necessarily...,Monica,Neutral,12,14
"Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.",Fake,Joyful,12,15
"Um, I'm not actually Amish.",Monica,Neutral,12,16
Really? Then why are you like that?,Fake,Neutral,12,17

The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.,Susan,Joyful,16,1
"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?",Ross,Scared,16,2
"You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.",Susan,Scared,16,3
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.,Ross,Joyful,16,4
This is so great.,Phoebe,Joyful,16,5
You wanna explain that?,Ross,Neutral,16,6
"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.",Phoebe,Sad,16,7

"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.",Ross,Joyful,21,0
"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.",Chandler,Joyful,21,2
He is so amazing.,Monica,Joyful,21,4

"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",Joey,Joyful,3,7
"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.",Rachel,Joyful,3,8
H-He's in China!,Chandler,Scared,3,9

How do you mean?,Joey,Neutral,5,9

"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",Monica,Peaceful,6,0
"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.",Rachel,Scared,6,1

She's still asleep.,Joey,Neutral,7,3
So how'd it go?,Chandler,Neutral,7,4
"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",Joey,Joyful,7,5
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,Chandler,Joyful,7,6
"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",Joey,Joyful,7,7
"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.",Chandler,Mad,7,8
"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",Joey,Joyful,7,9

You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?,Julie,Scared,11,10
"No, no, they will. I just... uh...",Ross,Neutral,11,11
Can't wait.,Julie,Neutral,11,12

God?,Chandler,Scared,4,10
"It was you, pal.",Ross,Joyful,4,11
"Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",Chandler,Scared,4,12
"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",Ross,Sad,4,13
"Well, you owe me one, big guy.",Chandler,Powerful,4,14
Here's your lemonade.,Rachel,Neutral,4,15

But...,Ross,Neutral,4,18
"Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?",Rachel,Scared,4,19
"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.",Chandler,Sad,4,20
How is that the silver lining?,Rachel,Mad,4,21
You have to really wanna see it.,Chandler,Powerful,4,22

"All right, that's it, I quit.",Phoebe,Mad,8,1
What? I didn't say anything.,Monica,Scared,8,2
"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.",Phoebe,Mad,8,3
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",Monica,Sad,8,4
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.,Phoebe,Mad,8,5
How who wears it?,Monica,Mad,8,6
Demi Moore.,Phoebe,Neutral,8,7
Demi Moore is not a he.,Monica,Mad,8,8

"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.",Ross,Joyful,11,6

"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?",Rachel,Scared,11,9
Okay.,Ross,Neutral,11,10
"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",Joey,Scared,11,11
That's ok.,Chandler,Peaceful,11,12
What's goin' on?,Ross,Scared,11,13
"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?",Rachel,Mad,11,14
"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?",Ross,Scared,11,15
No. No-no-no-no.,Rachel,Powerful,11,16
"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.",Ross,Mad,11,17
Really?,Rachel,Peaceful,11,18
"You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?",Ross,Peaceful,11,19
"No, I think that was the whole all.",Rachel,Sad,11,20
Okay. Okay. Okay.,Ross,Joyful,11,21
"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",Joey,Mad,11,22
"I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?",Julie,Neutral,12,1
"Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.",Phoebe,Joyful,12,2
Really?,Julie,Joyful,12,3
You wanna do it right now?,Phoebe,Scared,12,4
Great!,Julie,Joyful,12,5
"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",Phoebe,Scared,12,6
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.,Rachel,Peaceful,12,7
"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.",Phoebe,Peaceful,12,8
You're welcome.,Rachel,Neutral,12,9
"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.",Monica,Joyful,1,1
"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?",Phoebe,Joyful,1,2
"Oh, is he hungry already?",Susan,Neutral,1,3
I guess so.,Carol,Neutral,1,4
"You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.",Chandler,Neutral,1,5
"I gotta get one, too.",Joey,Neutral,1,6
What are you guys doing?,Ross,Scared,1,7
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?,Chandler,Neutral,1,8
"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.",Ross,Mad,1,9
"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",Joey,Neutral,1,10
"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",Ross,Mad,1,11
Carol?,Ross,Neutral,1,12
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?,Chandler,Neutral,1,13
Sure.,Carol,Neutral,1,14
"Uh, does it hurt?",Joey,Scared,1,15
"It did at first, but not anymore.",Carol,Neutral,1,16
Chandler?,Joey,Neutral,1,17
"So, uh, how often can you do it?",Chandler,Scared,1,18
As much as he needs.,Carol,Neutral,1,19
"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?",Joey,Joyful,1,20
"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?",Julie,Neutral,2,1
"Yeah, I forget which ones.",Rachel,Neutral,2,2
"Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?",Julie,Neutral,2,3
No thanks.,#ALL#,Neutral,2,4
"Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.",Julie,Neutral,2,5
Thank you. What a bitch.,Rachel,Mad,2,6
"Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?",Julie,Neutral,2,7
"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.",Phoebe,Neutral,2,8
"Ok, um, I'll go with you.",Monica,Neutral,2,9
Great.,Julie,Joyful,2,10
"Hi, honey.",Ross,Joyful,2,11
"Hey, sweetums.",Chandler,Joyful,2,12
Hello to the rest.,Ross,Neutral,2,13
Hi!,#ALL#,Joyful,2,14
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?,Joey,Neutral,2,15
"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?",Monica,Neutral,2,16
"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",Chandler,Mad,2,17
But I'm...,Monica,Neutral,2,18
"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.",Phoebe,Scared,2,19
"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?",Ross,Neutral,2,20
"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.",Monica,Neutral,2,21
"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.",Ross,Joyful,2,22
You're welcome.,Monica,Neutral,2,23
"Woof, woof.",Phoebe,Neutral,2,24
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.,Joey,Joyful,3,1
"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?",Annabelle,Neutral,3,2

Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.,Annabelle,Joyful,3,4
Hombre?,Hombre,Neutral,3,5
What's he doin' in my section?,Joey,Scared,3,6
I guess he doesn't know.,Annabelle,Neutral,3,7
"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?",Joey,Mad,3,8
Mornin'.,Hombre,Neutral,3,9
"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.",Joey,Mad,3,10
"Your territory, huh?",Hombre,Mad,3,11
Yeah. Bijan for men?,Joey,Powerful,3,12
No thanks.,Guy,Neutral,3,13

"We were shopping, and we had lunch.",Monica,Neutral,4,3
"Oh, all right. What did I have?",Phoebe,Neutral,4,4
You had a salad.,Monica,Neutral,4,5
"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,6
"Hey, guys, what's up.",Rachel,Neutral,4,7
"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,8
"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?",Rachel,Neutral,4,9
"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.",Phoebe,Scared,4,10
You went shopping for fur?,Rachel,Neutral,4,11
"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.",Phoebe,Scared,4,12
You bought boobs?,Rachel,Neutral,4,13
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.,Phoebe,Scared,4,14
"Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",Joey,Scared,5,1
"Oh, actually I sorta have plans.",Annabelle,Sad,5,2
"Ready, Annabelle?",Hombre,Neutral,5,3
You bet. Maybe some other time?,Annabelle,Neutral,5,4
"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!",Joey,Joyful,5,5
"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",Carol,Joyful,6,1
"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.",Ross,Powerful,6,2
"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.",Susan,Joyful,6,3
"Oh, this is so cute.",Rachel,Joyful,6,4
"Oh, I got that for him.",Susan,Joyful,6,5
My mommies love me. That's clever.,Ross,Joyful,6,6
"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.",Monica,Powerful,6,7
"Did you just say Hi, Jew?",Rachel,Neutral,6,8
"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",Monica,Joyful,6,9
"Ben, dinner!",Phoebe,Joyful,7,1
"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",Ross,Scared,7,2
"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",Phoebe,Powerful,7,3
What did you just do?,Chandler,Mad,7,4
"I licked my arm, what?",Phoebe,Powerful,7,5
It's breast milk.,Ross,Mad,7,6
So?,Phoebe,Neutral,7,7
"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",Rachel,Powerful,7,8
What is the big deal?,Joey,Powerful,7,9
What did you just do?,Chandler,Scared,7,10
"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",Ross,Mad,7,11
You won't even taste it?,Phoebe,Peaceful,7,12
No!,Ross,Mad,7,13
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,Phoebe,Peaceful,7,14
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.,Ross,Neutral,7,15
"Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.",Monica,Sad,9,1
Hey!,Carol,Joyful,9,2
How did we do?,Carol,Neutral,9,3
"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,4
I did not freak out.,Ross,Neutral,9,5
Why'd you freak out?,Carol,Neutral,9,6
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.,Ross,Scared,9,7
My breast milk is gross?,Carol,Mad,9,8
This should be fun.,Susan,Neutral,9,9
"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",Ross,Neutral,9,10
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,Chandler,Neutral,9,11
"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.",Carol,Neutral,9,12
That would be no.,Ross,Scared,9,13
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,Phoebe,Neutral,9,14
"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...",Joey,Neutral,9,15
Cantaloupe juice.,Susan,Neutral,9,16
Exactly.,Joey,Neutral,9,17
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.,Ross,Scared,9,18
Uh huh.,Susan,Neutral,9,19
"Oh, you've tasted it.",Ross,Neutral,9,20
"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.",Susan,Neutral,9,21
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.,Ross,Neutral,9,22
Howdy.,Chandler,Joyful,10,1
"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",Joey,Neutral,10,2
"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",Chandler,Neutral,10,3
"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",Joey,Sad,10,4
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,Chandler,Mad,10,5
"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",Joey,Mad,10,6
"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",Chandler,Neutral,10,7
Yeah I guess you're right.,Joey,Peaceful,10,8
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,Chandler,Mad,10,9
I'm gonna do it.,Joey,Powerful,10,10
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.,Chandler,Joyful,10,11
I don't know what else to say.,Monica,Sad,11,1
"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",Rachel,Powerful,11,2
"I feel terrible, I really do.",Monica,Sad,11,3
"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",Rachel,Mad,11,4
"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",Monica,Scared,11,5
Yes.,Rachel,Peaceful,11,6
It's that terrible?,Monica,Scared,11,7
"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.",Rachel,Sad,11,8
"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",Monica,Scared,11,9
I love you too.,Rachel,Peaceful,11,10
"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",Phoebe,Joyful,11,11
"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",Monica,Scared,11,12
"I'd do anything for you, you know that.",Rachel,Peaceful,11,13
I'd do anything for you.,Monica,Peaceful,11,14
"Wait, wait, wait, wait!",Phoebe,Peaceful,11,15
"Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",Joey,Mad,12,1
I heard ya.,Hombre,Neutral,12,2
"All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?",Store,Neutral,12,3
Ready.,Hombre,Neutral,12,4
"Yeah, I'm ready.",Joey,Powerful,12,5
"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!",Customer,Mad,12,6
"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?",Store,Mad,12,7
"I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.",Hombre,Scared,12,8
"My god, what happened?",Annabelle,Scared,12,9
"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",Joey,Neutral,12,10
Sure.,Annabelle,Neutral,12,11
So.,Julie,Neutral,13,1
"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",Rachel,Scared,13,2
"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.",Julie,Scared,13,3
Really? Me?,Rachel,Scared,13,4
"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",Julie,Sad,13,5
"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",Rachel,Neutral,13,6
Oy.,Julie,Sad,13,7
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",Rachel,Sad,13,8
"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?",Julie,Peaceful,13,9
"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",Rachel,Joyful,13,10
"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.",Julie,Neutral,13,11
"All right, Julie.",Rachel,Neutral,13,12
Bye.,Julie,Neutral,13,13
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.,Rachel,Mad,13,14
Mr. Heckles.,Monica,Neutral,2,0
How did this happen?,Rachel,Neutral,2,1
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.,Mr.,Sad,2,2
That's terrible.,Monica,Sad,2,3
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.,Mr.,Sad,2,4
"Sure, sweepin'. You never know.",Ross,Sad,2,5
You never know.,Mr.,Sad,2,6
"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",Phoebe,Sad,2,7
"Ok, Phoebe.",Chandler,Neutral,2,8
"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",Phoebe,Sad,2,9
Such as?,Joey,Neutral,2,10
"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",Phoebe,Joyful,2,11
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?",Ross,Scared,2,12
Nah. Not really.,Phoebe,Neutral,2,13
You don't believe in evolution?,Ross,Scared,2,14
"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,15
"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",Ross,Mad,2,16
"Yeah, I just don't buy it.",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,17
"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",Ross,Mad,2,18
"Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,19
"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",Ross,Mad,2,20
"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,21
"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",Chandler,Joyful,2,22
"There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.",Mr.,Joyful,3,0
What can we do for you?,Monica,Joyful,3,1
"All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine"".",Buddy,Peaceful,3,2
"Well, what about his family?",Monica,Sad,3,3
He didn't have any.,Buddy,Powerful,3,4
"Ok, so let's talk money.",Rachel,Peaceful,3,5
"All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.",Buddy,Powerful,3,6
How can you not believe in evolution?,Ross,Scared,5,0
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!,Phoebe,Joyful,5,1
"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",Ross,Scared,5,2
Really? You can actually see it?,Phoebe,Neutral,5,3
"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",Ross,Powerful,5,4
"See, I didn't know that.",Phoebe,Neutral,5,5
"Well, there you go.",Ross,Powerful,5,6
"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",Phoebe,Neutral,5,7
"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances.""",Chandler,Joyful,6,0
"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",Joey,Joyful,6,1
"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.",Chandler,Powerful,6,2
"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",Rachel,Joyful,6,3
"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",Monica,Mad,6,4
"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",Rachel,Joyful,6,5
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,Monica,Mad,6,6
"Well, what about my stuff?",Rachel,Mad,6,7
You don't have any stuff.,Monica,Powerful,6,8
"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",Rachel,Mad,6,9
No.,Monica,Neutral,6,10
"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",Rachel,Mad,6,11
Mmmmm.,Monica,Neutral,6,12
"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",Rachel,Powerful,6,13
"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",Ross,Joyful,7,0
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,Phoebe,Neutral,7,1
Please tell me you're joking.,Ross,Mad,7,2
"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",Phoebe,Mad,7,3
"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",Ross,Mad,7,4
"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",Phoebe,Mad,7,5
Is there blood coming out of my ears?,Ross,Scared,7,6
"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",Monica,Neutral,9,0
What?,Rachel,Neutral,9,1
Hide the Lamp.,Monica,Joyful,9,2
"Monica, let it go.",Rachel,Mad,9,3
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?,Monica,Mad,9,4
"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",Rachel,Mad,9,5
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.,Phoebe,Scared,10,0
"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",Ross,Joyful,10,1
"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",Phoebe,Peaceful,10,2
"It's the only possibility, Phoebe.",Ross,Mad,10,3
"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",Phoebe,Peaceful,10,4
"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",Ross,Joyful,10,5
I can't believe you caved.,Phoebe,Joyful,10,6
What?,Ross,Neutral,10,7
"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",Phoebe,Joyful,10,8

"Hey, how, how did you do that?",Stranger,Scared,1,8
"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?",Ross,Scared,3,1
"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",Chandler,Joyful,3,2
"You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.",Julie,Powerful,3,3
"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?",Chandler,Joyful,3,4
"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?",Ross,Joyful,3,5
"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.",Rachel,Mad,3,6

"I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",Monica,Mad,3,15
"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",Phoebe,Joyful,3,16
"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?",Ross,Joyful,3,17

"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.",Rachel,Mad,7,4
What's wrong with people having sex?,Ross,Scared,7,5
"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",Rachel,Mad,7,6
"Hell, I wanna see Joey.",Monica,Joyful,7,7
"So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.",Julie,Scared,7,8
"OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.",Chandler,Joyful,7,9
"All I say is, she better get the job.",Monica,Joyful,7,10
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.,Ross,Joyful,7,11
"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.",Joey,Scared,7,12

"I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.",Phoebe,Mad,8,9
"I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.",Duncan,Peaceful,8,10
So how long have you known?,Phoebe,Peaceful,8,11
"Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.",Duncan,Neutral,8,12
"And um, and there's actually a, a woman?",Phoebe,Neutral,8,13
Her name's Debra.,Duncan,Powerful,8,14
"Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?",Phoebe,Scared,8,15
"Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.",Duncan,Scared,8,16
Sure.,Phoebe,Scared,8,17
"But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.",Duncan,Powerful,8,18
"I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'",Phoebe,Scared,8,19
"I'm, I'm still me.",Duncan,Powerful,8,20
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?,Phoebe,Mad,8,21
"You know, it still smells like monkey in there.",Monica,Scared,9,1
That saves us a conversation.,Julie,Neutral,9,2
"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",Chandler,Neutral,9,3
"Me too, we should get goin'.",Joey,Neutral,9,4
"No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.",Rachel,Scared,9,5
"Rachel, that's all we do.",Monica,Neutral,9,6
"Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?",Rachel,Powerful,9,7
What about Julie?,Julie,Scared,9,8
"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.",Rachel,Scared,9,9
"Well, that could take a while.",Julie,Joyful,9,10
"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?",Rachel,Scared,9,11
I got the time to get to know Julie.,Chandler,Joyful,9,12

"Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.",Monica,Joyful,9,14

"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .",Duncan,Peaceful,10,2
"Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.",Phoebe,Scared,10,3
I love you Phoebe.,Duncan,Joyful,10,4
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.,Phoebe,Neutral,10,5
"Man, I sure miss Julie.",Ross,Sad,1,1
"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.",Chandler,Joyful,1,2
You ever figure out what that thing's for?,Ross,Neutral,1,3
"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.",Chandler,Neutral,1,4
"Here comes the beep, you know what to do.",Joey,Neutral,1,5
"Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?",Jade,Peaceful,1,6

"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",Chandler,Joyful,1,16
"Great, I'll see you then.",Jade,Joyful,1,17
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.,Chandler,Neutral,1,18
"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob.""",Ross,Neutral,1,19
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.",Chandler,Joyful,1,20
Oh my god. You are pure evil.,Ross,Joyful,1,21
"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.",Chandler,Joyful,1,22
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,Monica,Sad,5,1
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",Ross,Sad,5,2
"So, let's go.",Chandler,Neutral,5,3

"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",Monica,Joyful,6,11
"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.",Steven,Joyful,6,12

"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.",Phoebe,Joyful,2,1
Ok.,Rachel,Peaceful,2,2

"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?",Terry,Neutral,2,4
What's up?,Rachel,Powerful,2,5
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.,Terry,Neutral,2,6
But what about Phoebe?,Rachel,Mad,2,7
"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.",Terry,Neutral,2,8
"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.",Rachel,Mad,2,9
Uh--,Terry,Scared,2,10
"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?",Rachel,Mad,2,11
"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.",Phoebe,Joyful,2,12
"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",Chandler,Scared,3,1
"It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.",Joey,Joyful,3,2

"Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.",Joey,Joyful,3,12
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.,Caroline,Joyful,3,13

I think it's great you guys are doing this.,Caroline,Joyful,3,15

Here. I thought you might be cold.,Rachel,Peaceful,5,3
Thank you.,Phoebe,Joyful,5,4
"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.",Rachel,Powerful,5,5
"Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.",Phoebe,Sad,5,6
Do you?,Rachel,Neutral,5,7
"No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",Phoebe,Sad,5,8
"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!",Rachel,Neutral,5,9
"It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",Phoebe,Sad,5,10
"Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat"".",Rachel,Neutral,5,11
Really? From who?,Phoebe,Scared,5,12
"Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",Rachel,Peaceful,5,13
"Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.",Kid,Scared,5,14
Yeah. Here you go.,Phoebe,Neutral,5,15
"Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!",Kid,Joyful,5,16
"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?",Chandler,Sad,1,1
"So, how was the party?",Rachel,Neutral,1,2
"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?",Chandler,Sad,1,3
"No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.",Phoebe,Neutral,1,4
"Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?",Chandler,Scared,1,5
"No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.",Phoebe,Neutral,1,6
"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.",Monica,Powerful,1,7
"Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.",Chandler,Sad,1,8

"Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.",Chandler,Scared,1,11
"Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....",Phoebe,Joyful,1,12
"I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.",Michael,Scared,5,1
How long do cats live?,Rachel,Scared,5,2

"Um, maybe 15, 16 years.",Michael,Neutral,5,5
That's just great.,Rachel,Mad,5,6
"Um, cheers.",Michael,Joyful,5,7
"Oh, right, clink.",Rachel,Neutral,5,8
"Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?",Michael,Sad,5,9
"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.",Rachel,Sad,5,10
"Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.",Michael,Neutral,5,11
I mean he just started going out with her.,Rachel,Neutral,5,12
"Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?",Michael,Neutral,5,13
"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.",Rachel,Neutral,5,14
Alright.,Michael,Neutral,5,15
"OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?",Rachel,Neutral,5,16
"So, I figured it out.",Phoebe,Neutral,6,1
What?,Joey,Scared,6,2
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.,Phoebe,Sad,6,3
"Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack.""",Joey,Powerful,6,4
"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.",Phoebe,Joyful,6,5
"Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.",Joey,Powerful,6,6
"You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.",Phoebe,Joyful,6,7
"I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?",Rachel,Peaceful,7,1
Fruitflies?,Michael,Neutral,7,2
Yes! Thank you.,Rachel,Joyful,7,3
"So, would you like any dessert?",Waiter,Neutral,7,4
"No! No dessert, just a check, please.",Michael,Peaceful,7,5
"Oh, you're not having fun, are you?",Rachel,Sad,7,6
"No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.",Michael,Sad,7,7
"Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?",Rachel,Sad,7,8
"Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.",Michael,Sad,7,9
"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?",Rachel,Joyful,7,10
"Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you.""",Michael,Neutral,7,11
"Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo",Rachel,Powerful,7,12
Hang on.,Guy,Neutral,7,13
"Hello, excuse me.",Rachel,Neutral,7,14

"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.",Rachel,Powerful,7,16
I'm talkin'!,Guy,Mad,7,17
"I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.",Rachel,Neutral,7,18
"Alright, fine. I'll call you back.",Guy,Neutral,7,19
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.,Rachel,Peaceful,7,20
Good.,Michael,Neutral,7,21
"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.",Rachel,Mad,7,22
"No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.",Chandler,Mad,8,1
Why not?,Monica,Neutral,8,2
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.,Chandler,Powerful,8,3

"So, so how did it happen?",Joey,Joyful,10,10
"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.",Phoebe,Neutral,10,11
And what did he say?,Joey,Neutral,10,12
"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",Phoebe,Neutral,10,13
Wow.,Joey,Joyful,10,14
"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,15
"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.",Joey,Joyful,10,16
Um-hum.,Phoebe,Joyful,10,17
This man is my God.,Joey,Joyful,10,18

"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.",Ross,Mad,11,4
"Alright, I got it Ross.",Rachel,Neutral,11,5
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.,Ross,Sad,11,6
What?,Rachel,Sad,11,7
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.,Ross,Mad,11,8
"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",Rachel,Mad,11,9
Then you should have said something before I met her.,Ross,Mad,11,10
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.,Rachel,Mad,11,11
There was never a good time.,Ross,Sad,11,12
"Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.",Rachel,Sad,11,13
"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.",Ross,Sad,11,14
"Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?",Rachel,Mad,11,15
"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.",Ross,Mad,11,16
"Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?",Rachel,Mad,11,17
"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.",Ross,Mad,11,18
"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",Rachel,Mad,11,19
Fine.,Ross,Mad,11,20
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.,Rachel,Mad,11,21
Good.,Ross,Mad,11,22
Good.,Rachel,Mad,11,23
"And ya know what, now I've got closure.",Rachel,Mad,11,24
Try the bottom one.,Ross,Peaceful,11,25
"Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.",Chandler,Powerful,12,1
"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.",Monica,Powerful,12,2
"OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.",Chandler,Mad,12,3
"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?",Monica,Joyful,12,4
"Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.",Chandler,Peaceful,12,5
"Well, thanks.",Monica,Joyful,12,6
"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.",Chandler,Neutral,12,7
"Well, you know.",Monica,Neutral,12,8
"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.",Chandler,Neutral,12,9
Uh-huh.,Monica,Sad,12,10
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.,Chandler,Neutral,12,11
"Well no, but um.",Monica,Sad,12,12
"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.",Chandler,Neutral,12,13
"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .",Monica,Sad,12,14
"So, you feel like goin' for a run?",Chandler,Neutral,12,15
Alright.,Monica,Neutral,12,16
"Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.",Chandler,Neutral,12,17
OK. Just for a little while.,Monica,Neutral,12,18
OK.,Chandler,Joyful,12,19
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,1
Hey.,Joey,Neutral,1,2
Hey.,Chandler,Neutral,1,3
Hey.,Rachel,Neutral,1,4
"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?",Joey,Neutral,1,5
"Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.",Chandler,Neutral,1,6
"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",Monica,Neutral,1,7
And twenty-five it is.,Chandler,Joyful,1,8
You gave him cookies?,Joey,Neutral,1,9
"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",Monica,Neutral,1,10
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,Phoebe,Neutral,1,11
"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",Chandler,Scared,1,12
"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",Phoebe,Neutral,1,13
"So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?",Ross,Neutral,1,14
"Uhh, the mailman, the super.",Rachel,Neutral,1,15
"Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.",Monica,Peaceful,1,16
Oh my God.,Joey,Scared,1,17

"Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.",Rachel,Mad,1,20
"Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.",Monica,Mad,1,21
"Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.",Ross,Mad,1,22

"Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?",Grandmother,Scared,3,6
"Just, you know, to see... um.",Phoebe,Scared,3,7

"OK, is this really my father?",Phoebe,Scared,3,9
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.,Grandmother,Scared,3,10
"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",Phoebe,Mad,3,11
"Look, I. . .",Grandmother,Scared,3,12
"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.",Phoebe,Powerful,3,13
"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.",Grandmother,Sad,3,14
Oh God.,Phoebe,Sad,3,15
"It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.",Grandmother,Sad,3,16
"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",Phoebe,Mad,3,17
"Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.",Grandmother,Neutral,3,18
"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",Phoebe,Sad,3,19
Honey.,Grandmother,Neutral,3,20
Oh.,Phoebe,Sad,3,21
"Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.",Grandmother,Sad,3,22
Oh.,Phoebe,Neutral,3,23
"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",Chandler,Sad,4,1
"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",Rachel,Sad,4,2
Who said anything about Christmas?,Chandler,Neutral,4,3
Hi.,Monica,Neutral,4,4
"Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?",Ross,Neutral,4,5
"No, nothin'.",Rachel,Neutral,4,6
I hope she's OK.,Monica,Scared,4,7

"You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?",Monica,Neutral,4,14
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?,Chandler,Joyful,4,15
"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.",Rachel,Neutral,4,16
"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",Monica,Neutral,4,17
"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.",Joey,Joyful,4,18
"Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.",Ross,Peaceful,4,19
"Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .",Rachel,Mad,4,20
C'mon Rachel.,Ross,Neutral,4,21
"OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.",Rachel,Mad,4,22
"See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.",Ross,Scared,4,23
"Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.",Rachel,Joyful,4,24
"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.",Phoebe,Scared,5,1
Hey.,Grandmother,Neutral,5,2
"Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",Phoebe,Neutral,5,3
"C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?",Grandmother,Peaceful,5,4
"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.",Phoebe,Neutral,5,5
"Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.",Grandmother,Scared,5,6
"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",Phoebe,Neutral,5,7
"I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.",Grandmother,Sad,5,8
Whattaya mean?,Phoebe,Scared,5,9
"He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.",Grandmother,Powerful,5,10
Wow. Thank you.,Phoebe,Peaceful,5,11
"Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.",Grandmother,Neutral,5,12
"Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial",Phoebe,Peaceful,5,13

"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.",Chandler,Mad,6,2
"Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.",Joey,Scared,6,3
"Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.",Chandler,Scared,6,4
"Hey, here she comes.",Joey,Joyful,6,5
Hey.,Chandler,Neutral,6,6

"OK. Brake left, gas right?",Chandler,Scared,6,16
"Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.",Phoebe,Peaceful,6,17
Where's my seat belt?,Chandler,Scared,6,18
"Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.",Phoebe,Peaceful,6,19
Hey!,Chandler,Scared,6,20
Hey.,Joey,Scared,6,21
"C'mon, just tell me, please, please.",Ross,Scared,7,1
"For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.",Monica,Mad,7,2
"Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.",Rachel,Mad,7,3
"Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?",Monica,Peaceful,7,4
"Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .",Ross,Neutral,7,5
"Ross, the heat!",Monica,Mad,7,6
"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.",Ross,Scared,7,7
Did you just break the radiator?,Rachel,Mad,7,8
"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.",Ross,Scared,7,9
Well put it back.,Monica,Mad,7,10
"It uhh, it won't go back.",Ross,Scared,7,11
I'll call the super.,Rachel,Mad,7,12
"Here, let me try.",Monica,Peaceful,7,13
"Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.",Ross,Joyful,7,14
"Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.",Monica,Mad,7,15
"Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.",Rachel,Scared,7,16
"OK, tip the man.",Ross,Neutral,7,17
"No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.",Monica,Sad,7,18
"Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.",Ross,Joyful,7,19
"Ooh, this is it, 74.",Phoebe,Peaceful,8,1

"Alright, we're gettin' closer.",Chandler,Joyful,10,4
Uh-huh.,Phoebe,Neutral,10,5
"Phoebs, what's goin' on?",Joey,Peaceful,10,6
"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .",Phoebe,Scared,10,7
"Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.",Joey,Powerful,10,8
"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,9
"Well, so why not go knock?",Chandler,Peaceful,10,10
"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.",Phoebe,Scared,10,11
"Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.",Joey,Peaceful,10,12

"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.",Chandler,Peaceful,10,14
"Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.",Joey,Peaceful,10,15
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.,Phoebe,Sad,10,16
"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.",Chandler,Peaceful,10,17
"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.",Joey,Neutral,10,18
"Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!",Chandler,Scared,11,1
"Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?",Joey,Joyful,11,2
"Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.",Monica,Sad,11,3
"Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.",Ross,Joyful,11,4
"Oh, I couldn't go in.",Phoebe,Sad,11,5
"Honey, I'm sorry.",Monica,Powerful,11,6

"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",Ross,Neutral,1,1
So how did everything go?,Carol,Neutral,1,2

"Well, we've gotta go.",Carol,Peaceful,1,4
Ok.,Ross,Neutral,1,5
"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.",Carol,Neutral,1,7
"Oh, you and me?",Ross,Scared,1,8

"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?",Ross,Scared,1,13
"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.",Carol,Neutral,1,14
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,Ross,Scared,1,15
Look I just thought that...,Carol,Neutral,1,16
"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",Ross,Neutral,1,17
Is your finger caught in that chair?,Susan,Mad,1,18
Mmm hmmm.,Ross,Neutral,1,19
Want us to go?,Carol,Neutral,1,20
Uh-huh.,Ross,Neutral,1,21
That is so good! Do it again!,Ross,Joyful,3,1
"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",Joey,Joyful,3,2
"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",Chandler,Joyful,3,3
"No no, that's me.",Ross,Neutral,3,4
"Oh, yeah.",Chandler,Neutral,3,5
"Oh, hello.",Ross,Peaceful,3,6
"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",Phoebe,Peaceful,3,7
Is everything ok?,Ross,Scared,3,8
"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",Phoebe,Sad,3,9
Oh my god.,Ross,Scared,3,10
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,Chandler,Joyful,3,11
"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",Phoebe,Sad,3,12
"Oh, honey.",Monica,Peaceful,3,13
"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",Phoebe,Sad,3,14
What do you mean?,Rachel,Scared,3,15
I think it went into me.,Phoebe,Scared,3,16
Hi.,Monica,Neutral,7,1

It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.,Monica,Joyful,7,3

What's the matter?,Ross,Neutral,7,5
"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.",Carol,Sad,7,6
What?,Ross,Neutral,7,7
"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",Monica,Mad,7,8
"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?",Ross,Neutral,7,9
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.,Carol,Sad,7,10
Oh my god.,Ross,Neutral,7,11
"I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.",Carol,Sad,7,12
It's ok. I'm sorry.,Ross,Neutral,7,13
"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.",Carol,Scared,7,14
"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",Ross,Powerful,7,15
You do?,Carol,Mad,7,16
"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",Ross,Neutral,7,17
Of course I do.,Carol,Mad,7,18
"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",Ross,Mad,7,19
You're right. Of course you're right.,Carol,Neutral,7,20
So we're back on?,Monica,Scared,7,21
We're back on.,Carol,Powerful,7,22
"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",Monica,Powerful,7,23
"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",Joey,Powerful,8,1
"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",Chandler,Joyful,8,2
"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",Phoebe,Mad,8,3
Thank you.,Carol,Neutral,8,4
Any time.,Ross,Sad,8,5
Ross.,Carol,Peaceful,8,6
"You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.",Minister,Powerful,8,7
"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",Phoebe,Joyful,8,8
Would you look at them?,Monica,Joyful,9,1
"Yeah, can't help but.",Ross,Powerful,9,2
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.,Joey,Peaceful,9,3
I miss Rose.,Phoebe,Scared,9,4
"Oh, yeah?",Chandler,Sad,9,5
"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.",Phoebe,Sad,9,6
"You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?",Woman,Mad,9,7
"Ok, that's so nice.",Phoebe,Peaceful,9,8
"I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?",Chandler,Powerful,9,9
"Hey, Mom? Having fun?",Rachel,Joyful,9,10
"Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.",Sandra,Joyful,9,11
"There's more alcohol, right?",Rachel,Joyful,9,12
How you doin'?,Susan,Neutral,10,1
Ok.,Ross,Neutral,10,2
You did a good thing today.,Susan,Neutral,10,3
Yeah.,Ross,Neutral,10,4
You wanna dance?,Susan,Neutral,10,5
"No, that's fine.",Ross,Neutral,10,6
Come on. I'll let you lead.,Susan,Neutral,10,7
Ok.,Ross,Neutral,10,8
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.,Chandler,Sad,10,9
"Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?",Monica,Neutral,11,1
"Well, Mon, I was married.",Ross,Peaceful,11,2
"Yeah, me, too, technically.",Phoebe,Neutral,11,3
I had a wedding.,Rachel,Neutral,11,4
"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",Monica,Neutral,11,5
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?,Joey,Joyful,11,6
Isn't Ben in this?,Chandler,Mad,11,7
"Oh, yeah!",#ALL#,Joyful,11,8
That commercial always makes me so sad.,Ross,Sad,1,2
"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",Joey,Sad,1,3

What's 1922?,Rachel,Neutral,7,12
"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",Phoebe,Peaceful,7,13

"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",Phoebe,Mad,7,15

"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",Joey,Neutral,9,7
"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",Chandler,Powerful,9,8
"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",Joey,Mad,9,9
"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",Chandler,Mad,9,10

God that is good TV.,Chandler,Joyful,1,11

"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",Chandler,Joyful,2,3
Why don't you play with your roommate?,Phoebe,Neutral,2,4
"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",Chandler,Peaceful,2,5
"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",Phoebe,Neutral,2,6
"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",Chandler,Peaceful,2,7
"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",Phoebe,Powerful,2,8
We don't need to remedy that.,Chandler,Scared,2,9
"Oh yeah, it'll be fun.",Phoebe,Joyful,2,10

And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?",Eddie,Joyful,3,5

"Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",Joey,Peaceful,6,7
"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",Phoebe,Peaceful,6,8
"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",Joey,Joyful,6,9
"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",Joey,Mad,8,1

"They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.",Joey,Mad,8,3
Right. Could you sign this?,Delivery,Neutral,8,4

I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.,Delivery,Neutral,8,6
How can they do this to me?,Joey,Mad,8,7
"Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.",Delivery,Scared,8,8

"Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.",Ross,Mad,9,19
"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.",Rachel,Sad,9,20
Really?,Ross,Neutral,9,21
"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",Rachel,Scared,9,22
"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",Chandler,Mad,10,1
"That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.",Eddie,Mad,10,2
"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",Chandler,Mad,10,3
Where's Buddy?,Eddie,Neutral,10,4
Buddy?,Chandler,Scared,10,5
"My fish, Buddy.",Eddie,Neutral,10,6
There was no fish when she dropped it off.,Chandler,Neutral,10,7
"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?",Eddie,Mad,10,8
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?,Chandler,Mad,10,9

We came over as soon as we saw.,Chandler,Peaceful,13,11
How could you not tell us?,Ross,Sad,13,12
"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.",Joey,Sad,13,13
"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.",Rachel,Powerful,13,14
"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.",Joey,Sad,13,15
"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",Phoebe,Powerful,13,16
"Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",Joey,Sad,13,17
"Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",Phoebe,Powerful,13,18
"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.",Monica,Joyful,13,19
It's gonna be ok. You know that?,Chandler,Peaceful,13,20
"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",Joey,Sad,13,21
I'm sorry man.,Chandler,Peaceful,13,22
"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.",Rachel,Joyful,13,23

Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.,Chandler,Mad,1,10
"No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?",Eddie,Neutral,1,11

What?,Joey,Neutral,10,3
Five oh dollars.,Casting,Powerful,10,4
"Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.",Joey,Peaceful,10,5
That's great.,Casting,Mad,10,6
"And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.",Joey,Peaceful,10,7
"Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.",Casting,Powerful,10,8
"No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.",Joey,Powerful,10,9

Ohhh.,#ALL#,Mad,1,2
What?,Monica,Neutral,1,3
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,Ross,Neutral,1,4
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?,Monica,Scared,1,5
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,Ross,Neutral,1,6
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,Joey,Neutral,1,7
Yeah.,Ross,Neutral,1,8
"Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",Phoebe,Neutral,1,9
"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",Monica,Mad,1,10
"Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.",Monica,Mad,1,11

"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.",Monica,Neutral,2,2
"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",Joey,Powerful,2,3
Why not her?,Phoebe,Neutral,2,4
"Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",Joey,Neutral,2,5
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,Chandler,Mad,2,6
Joey that is horriable.,Monica,Mad,2,7
"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",Joey,Scared,2,8
"I'm sorry, I didn't know.",Phoebe,Sad,2,9
"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",Joey,Neutral,2,10
"Hi honey, how did it go?",Ross,Joyful,2,11
"Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",Rachel,Mad,2,12
"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",Chandler,Joyful,2,13
"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",Rachel,Mad,2,14
So what happened?,Monica,Neutral,2,15
"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",Rachel,Mad,2,16
"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",Phoebe,Neutral,2,17
"Well, how bout just her mom?",Monica,Neutral,2,18
Why her mom?,Chandler,Scared,2,19
Cause I already invited her.,Monica,Neutral,2,20

"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",Chandler,Joyful,6,1
"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",Rachel,Sad,6,2
"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",Chandler,Neutral,6,3
"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",Rachel,Sad,6,4
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,Chandler,Neutral,6,5
"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",Rachel,Peaceful,6,6
"I, I know.",Chandler,Peaceful,6,7
"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.",Monica,Peaceful,7,1

No no no.,Guys,Scared,7,14
"Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.",Leonard,Powerful,7,15
"Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",Chandler,Joyful,7,16
"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.",Phoebe,Scared,7,17
"I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.",Leonard,Powerful,7,18
"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",Phoebe,Scared,7,19

"Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.",Phoebe,Neutral,8,5
"Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.",Rachel,Joyful,8,6
"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",Rachel,Neutral,1,1

All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.,Joey,Neutral,1,4

"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",Joey,Scared,1,6
'Cause he was just so darn cute.,Chandler,Joyful,1,7
"No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",Joey,Neutral,1,8
"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.",Ross,Peaceful,1,9
"I did do it, I'm a professional.",Joey,Peaceful,1,10
Then what's the problem?,Monica,Mad,1,11
"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.",Joey,Mad,1,12
"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.",Phoebe,Peaceful,1,13
"Hey, what did your agent say?",Chandler,Neutral,2,1
"Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",Joey,Sad,2,2

"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",Phoebe,Joyful,2,8
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?,Joey,Sad,2,9
"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.",Monica,Peaceful,2,10
"Yeah, that makes sense.",Joey,Joyful,2,11
Over my dead body!,Ross,Mad,2,12
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.,Chandler,Neutral,2,13
"Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.",Monica,Joyful,4,1
"Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.",Richard,Joyful,4,2
"Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.",Monica,Neutral,4,3

Oh dear God.,Rachel,Scared,10,12
"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.",Phoebe,Neutral,3,11
Well thanks.,Guy,Neutral,3,12
"Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?",Phoebe,Peaceful,3,13

Good. So what were you thinking?,Phoebe,Peaceful,7,10
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.,Malcom,Joyful,7,11

Were you following me?,Malcom,Scared,10,5
"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,6
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.,Malcom,Scared,10,7
"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?",Phoebe,Neutral,10,8
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.",Malcom,Sad,10,9
"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,10
"Uh-huh, I don't know.",Malcom,Scared,10,11
"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?",Phoebe,Neutral,10,12

"Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.",Janice,Joyful,5,3
"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",Chandler,Peaceful,5,4
"Oh, you didn't have to do this.",Janice,Neutral,5,5
"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.",Chandler,Joyful,5,6
"Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.",Janice,Joyful,5,7
"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.",Chandler,Joyful,5,8
We should?,Janice,Neutral,5,9
"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",Chandler,Joyful,5,10
"I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?",Janice,Joyful,5,11
"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.",Chandler,Joyful,5,12
You probably want us to move in together?,Janice,Neutral,5,13
It doesn't scare me!,Chandler,Joyful,5,14
"Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...",Janice,Scared,5,15

Uff.,Monica,Neutral,6,3

Then I got all needy and clingy.,Chandler,Neutral,6,5
"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?",Rachel,Peaceful,6,6
She said she'd call me.,Chandler,Neutral,6,7

"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.",Rachel,Neutral,6,12
"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.",Monica,Powerful,6,13
"Yeah, you do.",Rachel,Neutral,6,14
"So, you don't think I'm terminal?",Chandler,Joyful,6,15
"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.",Monica,Peaceful,6,16
"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",Chandler,Joyful,6,17
Nooo!,Monica,Powerful,6,18
"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.",Rachel,Neutral,6,19
She has to know that your not ready.,Monica,Peaceful,6,20
"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",Rachel,Neutral,6,21
"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",Chandler,Joyful,6,22
"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",Rachel,Neutral,6,23
"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",Chandler,Neutral,6,24

"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.",Phoebe,Sad,7,16
"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.",Joey,Peaceful,7,17
"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",Phoebe,Sad,7,18
They actually said that?,Joey,Sad,7,19
"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...",Phoebe,Sad,7,20
"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.",Joey,Powerful,7,21
"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",Phoebe,Neutral,7,22
"You'll never get me, Joe!!!",Ross,Joyful,7,23
"No, thank you. Chandler!",Janice,Neutral,8,1

Who's party is it?,Janice,Neutral,8,13
A woman's,Chandler,Neutral,8,14
What woman?!,Janice,Mad,8,15
Chelsea.,Chandler,Peaceful,8,16
"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?",Janice,Mad,8,17
Can I be that guy?,Chandler,Neutral,8,18
"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,1
"Okay, shoot.",Joey,Neutral,9,2
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,3

"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,5
"Okay, what else?",Joey,Neutral,9,6
"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'",Phoebe,Neutral,9,7
Oh.,Joey,Sad,9,8
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",Phoebe,Neutral,9,9
"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.",Joey,Sad,9,10
Oh.,Phoebe,Sad,9,11
"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.",Joey,Neutral,9,12
"Yeah, no, I understand.",Phoebe,Sad,9,13
"You do, thanks.",Joey,Neutral,9,14
Yeah. Sorry.,Phoebe,Sad,9,15
Wait a minute.,Joey,Neutral,9,16
What?,Phoebe,Neutral,9,17
"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.",Joey,Neutral,9,18
"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",Phoebe,Joyful,9,19
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.,Joey,Joyful,9,20
"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.",Chandler,Sad,10,1
"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",Monica,Scared,10,2
"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?",Chandler,Sad,10,3
"Yeah, it is.",Rachel,Neutral,10,4
"You know what, everything's gonna be okay.",Monica,Peaceful,10,5
"Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?",Chandler,Scared,10,7
"Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.",Rachel,Scared,10,8
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.,Monica,Scared,10,9
Yeah.,Rachel,Neutral,10,10
Hello!,Chandler,Joyful,10,11
"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.",Monica,Powerful,10,12
"Yes, and grumpy.",Rachel,Peaceful,10,13
"What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!",Chandler,Scared,10,14
"He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.",Rachel,Peaceful,10,15
I love you too.,Chandler,Joyful,10,16
"Aw, it's soo unfair.",Monica,Sad,10,17
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!,Carol,Mad,11,1

"What'd you do, dip it in sugar?",Susan,Mad,11,3
"Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'",Ross,Mad,11,4
"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.",Monica,Mad,11,5

"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.",Monica,Mad,11,7
What are you talking about?,Ross,Scared,11,8
"The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.",Monica,Powerful,11,9
"Okay, you are totally making this up.",Ross,Mad,11,10

Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done.

"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",Rachel,Sad,10,14
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.",Ross,Sad,10,15

"Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?",Sarah,Neutral,4,16
"Yeah, Sarah, anything.",Ross,Peaceful,4,17

It's good to see you.,Richard,Peaceful,1,17

"Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.",Leslie,Peaceful,12,4
"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",Phoebe,Joyful,12,5
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.,Leslie,Neutral,12,6
"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",Phoebe,Powerful,12,7
"Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.",Leslie,Sad,12,8
"That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.",Phoebe,Neutral,12,9
Hi!,Monica,Joyful,14,1
Hey.,Chandler,Joyful,14,2
"Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.",Monica,Joyful,14,3

"Joey told you about the leg, huh?",Chandler,Neutral,14,8
Uh-huh.,Monica,Powerful,14,9
"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.",Chandler,Powerful,14,10
Morning.,Joey,Joyful,14,11
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.,Chandler,Powerful,14,12
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?,Joey,Peaceful,14,13
It came up.,Chandler,Neutral,14,14
"Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?",Joey,Sad,14,15
So I nodded off a little.,Ross,Sad,15,1
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!,Rachel,Mad,15,2
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.,Ross,Mad,15,3
"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'",Rachel,Mad,15,4
"First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.",Ross,Mad,15,5
"Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.",Rachel,Mad,15,6
"Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.",Ross,Mad,15,7
"Oh, that is so...",Rachel,Mad,15,8
"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.",Ross,Joyful,15,9
"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?",Rachel,Scared,15,10
"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.",Ross,Sad,15,11
"It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.",Rachel,Peaceful,15,12
That's a little clearer.,Ross,Neutral,15,13
"Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",Rachel,Peaceful,15,14
"Sure, I-I-I...",Ross,Scared,15,15
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?,Ginger,Neutral,16,1
"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",Chandler,Peaceful,16,2
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?,Ginger,Sad,16,3
No. No. I don't think so.,Chandler,Neutral,16,4
"Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.",Ginger,Neutral,16,5
What's that?,Ginger,Neutral,16,7
That's-that's my nubbin.,Chandler,Neutral,16,8
What's a nubbin?,Ginger,Neutral,16,9
"It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.",Chandler,Peaceful,16,10

"Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?",Chandler,Joyful,16,12
"Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.",Ginger,Scared,16,13
"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?",Chandler,Sad,16,14
"Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.",Ginger,Scared,16,15
"Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?",Phoebe,Scared,17,1
"Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.",Leslie,Scared,17,2
"Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay",Phoebe,Mad,17,3
"I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.",Leslie,Joyful,17,4
"No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.",Phoebe,Mad,17,5
"No, no, I don't want to forget it.",Leslie,Sad,17,6
"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?",Phoebe,Mad,17,7
"Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.",Commercial,Neutral,18,1
"Sorry, Pheebs.",Monica,Sad,18,3
Yeah. You okay?,Joey,Neutral,18,4

"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!",Monica,Joyful,19,8
"That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!",Chandler,Powerful,19,9
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!,Chandler,Neutral,2,1

"Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.",Issac,Powerful,2,5

"He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'",Mischa,Neutral,3,2
"Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.",Phoebe,Neutral,3,3

I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.,Rachel,Mad,7,4
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?,Ross,Mad,7,5

"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.",Ross,Mad,7,7
"But I told you, I didn't have the time!",Rachel,Mad,7,8

Well neither do I!,Rachel,Mad,7,16
Is this about Mark?,Ross,Mad,7,17
Oh my God.,Rachel,Mad,7,18

No. A break from us.,Rachel,Mad,7,24
"And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.",Chloe,Joyful,8,1
"Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.",Chloe,Joyful,8,3
"Oh, hi Chloe.",Ross,Joyful,8,4
"I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'",Chloe,Joyful,8,5
And that's the only colour that comes in.,Chandler,Neutral,8,6
"Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?",Issac,Joyful,8,7
Oh!,Chloe,Mad,8,8
"So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",Chandler,Neutral,8,9
"Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.",Ross,Mad,8,10
"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?",Monica,Joyful,9,1
"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.",Mischa,Joyful,9,2
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.,Monica,Powerful,9,3
"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",Phoebe,Joyful,9,4

"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",Phoebe,Joyful,9,12
"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?",Mischa,Joyful,9,14
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.,Monica,Joyful,9,15

"Well, I was having a conversation.",Monica,Scared,9,18
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.",Phoebe,Mad,9,19
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?,Monica,Sad,9,20
That would be great. Thank you.,Phoebe,Joyful,9,21
Hello!,Rachel,Joyful,10,1
"Oh, hi. It's Mark.",Mark,Joyful,10,2

It's for me.,Mark,Peaceful,10,14
"Oh. Okay, bye.",Rachel,Sad,10,15

"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?",Ross,Mad,11,4

"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",Joey,Peaceful,11,8
Why? What happened to him?,Chandler,Neutral,11,9
"Nothing, he's just really believes in that.",Joey,Neutral,11,10
"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.",Rachel,Sad,12,1
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?,Mark,Neutral,12,2

They have the best stuff in there.,Phoebe,Peaceful,7,17
Oh my God! Oh my God!,Chandler,Scared,8,1
"Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",Joey,Powerful,8,2
"You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.",Ross,Sad,8,3
"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",Chandler,Joyful,8,4
"What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",Ross,Peaceful,8,5
"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.",Joey,Peaceful,8,6
"He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.",Chandler,Neutral,8,7
"Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.",Joey,Neutral,8,8
"Yeah, but don't you think....",Ross,Neutral,8,9
"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.",Chandler,Powerful,8,10
"Yeah, okay.",Ross,Peaceful,8,11
"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?",Joey,Peaceful,8,12
What trail?,Ross,Neutral,8,13
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!,Joey,Powerful,8,14
"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.",Ross,Peaceful,8,15
"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!",Chandler,Powerful,8,16
"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",Phoebe,Neutral,9,1
Did that!,Monica,Powerful,9,2
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,Phoebe,Neutral,9,3
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!,Monica,Sad,9,4
Was it not pain-free?,Phoebe,Neutral,9,5
"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",Monica,Mad,9,6
"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,7
"That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.",Monica,Neutral,9,8
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,Phoebe,Mad,9,9
"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?",Monica,Neutral,9,10
Jasmine?,Ross,Mad,11,1
Uh-huh.,Jasmine,Joyful,11,2
"We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.",Ross,Mad,11,3
You did a bad thing!,Jasmine,Mad,11,4
"Yes, I did.",Ross,Peaceful,11,5
Very bad!,Jasmine,Sad,11,6
Very bad.,Ross,Sad,11,7
"Very, very bad.",Jasmine,Mad,11,8
"I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",Ross,Peaceful,11,9
No.,Jasmine,Neutral,11,10
"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",Ross,Joyful,11,11
All right.,Jasmine,Peaceful,11,12
"Thank you, thank you.",Ross,Peaceful,11,13
"But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.",Jasmine,Scared,11,14
Who's your roommate?,Ross,Mad,11,15
They've been quiet for a long time.,Phoebe,Neutral,14,1
Maybe she killed him?,Joey,Scared,14,2
Let's go.,Chandler,Scared,14,3
Is that your new walk?,Chandler,Neutral,14,5
"No, I really have to pee.",Joey,Sad,14,6
"Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!",Joey,Neutral,3,1
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.,Phoebe,Neutral,3,2
"Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.",Ross,Joyful,3,3
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.,Chandler,Neutral,3,4
"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!",Ross,Joyful,3,5
It'll be great for next weekend.,Joey,Joyful,3,6
"No, no, no, this weekend guys!",Ross,Neutral,3,7
"It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.",Joey,Joyful,3,8
What's going on?,Ross,Neutral,3,9
"Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.",Phoebe,Neutral,3,10
"So, for the whole weekend?",Ross,Sad,3,11
"We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.",Monica,Neutral,3,12
"Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.",Ross,Sad,3,13
"Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",Phoebe,Neutral,3,14
"Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.",Joey,Neutral,3,15
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.,Monica,Sad,3,16
What a pity stay?,Ross,Sad,3,17
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!,Monica,Joyful,3,18
"Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.",Ross,Sad,3,19
"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.",Chandler,Neutral,3,20
"Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?",Joey,Sad,4,1
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?,Monica,Powerful,4,2
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.,Chandler,Peaceful,4,3
What? Mine aren't tinted.,Joey,Scared,4,4
Chandler!!,Phoebe,Peaceful,4,6
What?,Chandler,Neutral,4,7
What does the sign say?,Phoebe,Peaceful,4,8

It's not that kind of anniversary.,Carol,Neutral,7,11
Ah! Oh.,Ross,Neutral,7,12
Sooo!! Anyway...,Carol,Neutral,7,13
"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.",Ross,Sad,7,14
"Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.",Carol,Sad,7,15
"Yeah, well.",Ross,Neutral,7,16
"Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?",Carol,Peaceful,7,17
"Oh yeah, I'd love that.",Ross,Joyful,7,18
"Oh, great! Me too.",Carol,Joyful,7,19
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.,Ross,Sad,7,20
"Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.",Phoebe,Neutral,8,1
Great!,Rachel,Joyful,8,2
"Yeah, what town are we near?",Phoebe,Neutral,8,3

"Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?",Phoebe,Mad,8,7
"I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",Rachel,Scared,8,8

"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",Rachel,Scared,8,10
"Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",Monica,Scared,8,11
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",Rachel,Mad,8,12
But if...,Phoebe,Scared,8,13
"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.",Rachel,Mad,8,14
"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",Phoebe,Joyful,8,15
So the going for help went well?,Monica,Neutral,8,17

Then why are you smoking?,Monica,Mad,8,20
Well it's very unsettling.,Chandler,Neutral,8,21

"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.",Monica,Neutral,9,11
"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.",Phoebe,Sad,9,12
"Oh, now you want a favour?",Ross,Mad,9,13
"Yes, please.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,14
"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",Ross,Neutral,9,15
"Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.",Carol,Powerful,9,16
"No, I'm not gonna pick them up.",Ross,Powerful,9,17
"Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",Carol,Powerful,9,18
"No, Rachel doesn't want me to....",Ross,Sad,9,19
"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",Carol,Neutral,9,20
"Yeah, you're right.",Ross,Neutral,9,21

"You're a genius, Ross.",Carol,Joyful,11,5

"Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.",Chandler,Joyful,1,16
"Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.",Rachel,Mad,1,17
Pffhah.,Ross,Neutral,1,18
What's your problem?,Rachel,Mad,1,19
"Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.",Ross,Mad,1,20
"Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.",Rachel,Powerful,1,21
"Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.",Ross,Mad,1,22
"Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",Rachel,Powerful,1,23
"All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",Phoebe,Mad,1,24
Or what my Father called Thursday night.,Chandler,Neutral,1,25
"And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.",Monica,Sad,4,1

"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",Monica,Mad,4,7
"Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?",Peter,Joyful,4,8
"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",Rachel,Joyful,4,9
"I mean really, think about it.",Monica,Joyful,4,10
"Ho-ho, I will.",Peter,Joyful,4,11
"No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!",Phoebe,Mad,5,1
"Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?",Ross,Scared,5,2
"No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!",Phoebe,Scared,5,3
"Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.",Joey,Mad,5,4
"But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.",Phoebe,Mad,5,5
"Well, have-have you told him how you feel?",Joey,Scared,5,6

No-no-no-no-no.,Joey,Scared,5,10
"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",Phoebe,Powerful,5,11
No.,Joey,Scared,5,12
"Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.",Phoebe,Powerful,5,13
"So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, ""Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,"" remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, ""Nah, let's just hang out at your place."" Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.",Joey,Mad,5,14
"Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.",Phoebe,Joyful,9,1
"Oh my God, who died on this?!",Alice,Scared,9,2
"Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",Phoebe,Scared,9,3

"Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.",Phoebe,Mad,9,5
"Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.",Alice,Peaceful,9,6
"Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",Phoebe,Mad,9,7
"Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.",Peter,Peaceful,10,1

"Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?",Monica,Mad,10,8
"Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.",Peter,Neutral,10,9
"You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?",Monica,Mad,10,10
"Umm, I'm still here.",Employee,Neutral,10,11
"You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.",Peter,Powerful,10,12
What?!,Monica,Mad,10,13

"Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.",Frank,Sad,11,7
"Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?",Phoebe,Peaceful,11,8
"Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.",Frank,Sad,11,9
"Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?",Phoebe,Peaceful,11,10

After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing!

"Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",Phoebe,Sad,11,14
What?,Frank,Scared,11,15
"Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.",Phoebe,Joyful,11,16
"Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?",Frank,Mad,11,17

"Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.",Kate,Scared,8,6
"Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.",The,Powerful,8,7
Yeah.,Joey,Neutral,8,8
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.,Kate,Neutral,8,9
"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.",Joey,Mad,8,10

"What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.",Ross,Joyful,10,7
"Ohh, that's too bad!",Phoebe,Sad,10,8
"No, I-I'm saying I liked her.",Ross,Scared,10,9
"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,10
"Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.",Ross,Joyful,10,11
"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",Phoebe,Peaceful,10,12
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?,Chandler,Powerful,10,13
"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.",Ross,Peaceful,10,14
"Hey, the fight's starting!",Joey,Joyful,10,15
"Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",Ross,Neutral,10,16
"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",Chandler,Joyful,10,17
Fight's over!,Joey,Mad,10,18
"Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!",Chandler,Joyful,11,1
Bing! You got those numbers for me?,Doug,Joyful,11,2
"No, I ah, I didn't do them.",Chandler,Neutral,11,3
"Oh, you forgot?",Doug,Sad,11,4
"No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",Chandler,Joyful,11,5
"Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!",Doug,Joyful,11,6
Doug!!,Chandler,Mad,11,7
Hmm.,Doug,Neutral,11,8
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,Chandler,Mad,11,9
"Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!",Doug,Mad,11,10
"No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",Chandler,Scared,11,11
Oh?,Doug,Neutral,11,12
"Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.",Chandler,Neutral,11,13
"Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.",Doug,Joyful,11,14
Okay.,Chandler,Neutral,11,15
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!,Doug,Joyful,11,16
Ahhhhh!,Chandler,Mad,11,17
"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",Phoebe,Mad,12,1
"Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.",Rachel,Mad,12,2
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!,Phoebe,Powerful,12,4
Phoebe!,Rachel,Neutral,12,5
"Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.",Phoebe,Neutral,12,6
"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",Rachel,Neutral,12,7
"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",Phoebe,Neutral,12,8
"Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",Rachel,Mad,12,9
You said it was okay!,Phoebe,Mad,12,10
You said she was bald!!,Rachel,Mad,12,11
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!,Phoebe,Mad,12,12
"Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",Rachel,Mad,12,13
"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?",Phoebe,Peaceful,12,14
Yes.,Rachel,Neutral,12,15
Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?,Phoebe,Peaceful,12,16
Yes.,Rachel,Sad,12,17
So?,Phoebe,Neutral,12,18
"I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!",Rachel,Sad,12,19
Oh no.,Phoebe,Peaceful,12,20
What?,Rachel,Neutral,12,21
"Oh, we killed them all.",Phoebe,Mad,12,22
Oh!,Rachel,Scared,12,23
"It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.",Peter,Joyful,13,1
Please tell me you're stopping now.,Monica,Scared,13,2
"I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.",Peter,Peaceful,13,3
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!,Monica,Scared,13,4
"I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.",Peter,Joyful,13,5
"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",Monica,Mad,13,6
"Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.",Peter,Scared,13,7
"Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.",Monica,Mad,13,8
"Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.",Peter,Neutral,13,9
Then I've gotta go. Bye.,Monica,Sad,13,10
Mon-Monica?,Peter,Scared,13,11
Yes?,Monica,Peaceful,13,12
"Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.",Peter,Peaceful,13,13
"So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.",Doug,Joyful,14,1
"Thank you, sir.",Chandler,Neutral,14,2
"Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.",Stevens,Neutral,14,3
"Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?",Doug,Neutral,14,4
"No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.",Chandler,Mad,14,5
"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?",Doug,Neutral,14,6
"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",Chandler,Neutral,14,7
"Now get on out of here, you!",Doug,Joyful,14,8

"Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.",Tv,Sad,15,7
Oh! Oh!,#ALL#,Scared,15,8
"Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",Phoebe,Neutral,15,9
"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.",Ross,Neutral,15,10
Ohh!!,#ALL#,Joyful,15,11
"So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!",Chandler,Joyful,1,1
"All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.",Bonnie,Powerful,1,2
Tell it again. Seriously.,Chandler,Joyful,1,3
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?,Rachel,Mad,1,5
"Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.",Joey,Neutral,1,6
"Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.",Monica,Mad,1,7
"Well, I think we all learned something.",Joey,Peaceful,1,8
"Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,9
"Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.",Chandler,Neutral,1,10
Y'know what that means?,Phoebe,Joyful,1,11
That you're actually 50?,Joey,Joyful,1,12
"No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,13
Oh!,#ALL#,Joyful,1,14
That is so cool.,Rachel,Joyful,1,15
"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",Phoebe,Joyful,1,16
"Yeah! Yeah, we can!",#ALL#,Joyful,1,17

"Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.",Phoebe,Joyful,4,1
"Knock, knock, knock.",Phoebe,Joyful,4,2

"Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?",Phoebe,Scared,4,4
"Ahh, yes.",Phoebe,Scared,4,5
"Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!",Phoebe,Joyful,4,6
You're Erwin's daughter?!,Phoebe,Joyful,4,7
"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?",Phoebe,Joyful,4,8
"Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?",Phoebe,Joyful,4,9

You didn't even take off your pants.,Monica,Neutral,6,4
"Yeah, well, lucky for you.",Chandler,Mad,6,5

Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!,Rachel,Joyful,6,8

"Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.",Bonnie,Joyful,7,5

"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.",Rachel,Powerful,7,8

Could we be more white trash?,Chandler,Neutral,1,7
How desperate am I?,Monica,Joyful,2,1
"Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.",Rachel,Peaceful,2,2
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.,Monica,Powerful,2,3
How come?,Phoebe,Neutral,2,4
"Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",Monica,Peaceful,2,5
"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.",Ross,Joyful,2,6
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.,Monica,Peaceful,2,7
"Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",Rachel,Joyful,3,1

"Hello, Rachel.",Joanna,Joyful,3,8
"Well, not at first.",Chandler,Scared,3,9

"I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'",Rachel,Mad,3,12
"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",Chandler,Scared,3,13
"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",Rachel,Mad,3,15
"Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.",Chandler,Scared,3,16
"Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.",Rachel,Mad,3,18

Let me ask you a question.,Monica,Scared,4,6
Hmm.,Judy,Mad,4,7
Why did you hire me?,Monica,Joyful,4,8
"Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.",Judy,Mad,4,9
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.,Monica,Joyful,4,10
"Okay, I didn't hear that.",Phoebe,Scared,4,11
"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.",Monica,Joyful,4,12
"Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!",Phoebe,Joyful,4,13

"No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.",Joey,Peaceful,5,4
"Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?",The,Sad,5,5
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.,Ross,Mad,5,8

"Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.",Monica,Powerful,10,6
"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.",Phoebe,Neutral,10,7
What?,Monica,Sad,10,8
"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."" Though some things don't change.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,9
"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.",Monica,Powerful,10,10

So? Huh? What do you think?,Kathy,Neutral,11,3
"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",Chandler,Neutral,11,4
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!,Kathy,Peaceful,11,5
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.,Chandler,Peaceful,11,6
"Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!",Kathy,Joyful,11,7
"Uhh, no-no thanks.",Chandler,Peaceful,11,8
"Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.",Kathy,Joyful,11,9
"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.",Chandler,Joyful,11,10
I'll be right back. What was that?,Joey,Peaceful,11,11
What?,Chandler,Neutral,11,12
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,Joey,Powerful,11,13
"Hey, look, what do you want from me?",Chandler,Peaceful,11,14
"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",Joey,Mad,11,15
I am pretending.,Chandler,Neutral,11,16
"Well then, do it better!",Joey,Neutral,11,17
"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",Chandler,Neutral,11,18
"Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",Joey,Neutral,11,19
"Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",Ross,Neutral,12,1
"No, sorry.",Monica,Scared,12,2
Well where's Amanda?,Rachel,Joyful,12,3
"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",Monica,Sad,12,4
"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",Rachel,Joyful,12,5
"Ross, cough drops, please?",Monica,Sad,12,6
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.,Ross,Mad,12,7
"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",Rachel,Mad,12,8
You see Amanda and I have a very special...,Ross,Powerful,12,9
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!,Monica,Mad,12,10
"Ohh, that is soo sad.",Rachel,Joyful,12,11
"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",Monica,Mad,12,12
"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!",Rachel,Mad,12,14
"That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",Monica,Mad,12,15
Fine.,Ross,Neutral,12,16
Sorry.,Rachel,Scared,12,17
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.,Ross,Powerful,12,18
Y'know...,Rachel,Peaceful,12,19
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.,Phoebe,Joyful,16,1
Rachel?,Gunther,Scared,16,3
Yeah.,Rachel,Neutral,16,4
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_,Gunther,Neutral,16,5
No!,Rachel,Neutral,16,6
"Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.",Gunther,Scared,16,7
Okay.,Rachel,Scared,16,8
"So umm, are we cool?",Gunther,Powerful,16,9
Okay.,Rachel,Scared,16,10
I knew you'd understand.,Gunther,Mad,16,11
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,Chandler,Scared,1,1
"Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.",Ross,Joyful,1,2
"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!",Chandler,Scared,1,3
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,Phoebe,Joyful,1,5
Yeah! Oh my God!,#ALL#,Joyful,1,6
Here you go.,Casey,Neutral,2,1
"Great! All right, so I'll call you later.",Joey,Peaceful,2,2
Great!,Casey,Joyful,2,3
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?,Chandler,Peaceful,2,4
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.,Joey,Joyful,2,5
"Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",Chandler,Joyful,2,6
"No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",Joey,Powerful,2,7
What?,Chandler,Scared,2,8
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,Joey,Joyful,2,9
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!,Chandler,Mad,2,10
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,Joey,Joyful,2,11
"Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",Chandler,Mad,2,12
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,Joey,Powerful,2,13
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.",Chandler,Joyful,2,14
You got all that from the back of her head?,Joey,Scared,2,15
"All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",Chandler,Peaceful,2,16
Who's Elaine?,Joey,Powerful,2,17
"No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!",Chandler,Sad,5,1
Horrible!,Kathy,Scared,5,2
"Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?",Chandler,Scared,5,3
"No-no-no, the kiss was good.",Kathy,Peaceful,5,4
Okay!,Chandler,Peaceful,5,5
"No, but that's bad!",Kathy,Sad,5,6
"Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.",Chandler,Peaceful,5,7
What?!,Kathy,Neutral,5,8
"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?",Chandler,Sad,5,9
Can you really do that?,Kathy,Scared,5,10
"I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.",Chandler,Scared,5,11
"Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...",Kathy,Sad,5,12
"Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.",Chandler,Neutral,5,13
"I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.",Kathy,Neutral,5,14
I-I think we have too.,Chandler,Scared,5,15
Okay. Bye.,Kathy,Peaceful,5,16
Bye. Are you still out there?,Chandler,Neutral,5,17
No.,Kathy,Scared,5,18
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...,Ross,Neutral,6,1
"Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.",Monica,Peaceful,6,2
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!,Phoebe,Joyful,6,3
Thank you guys-guys-guys...,Ross,Neutral,6,5
"Hey, aren't you up next?",Monica,Joyful,6,6
"Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.",Phoebe,Sad,6,7
Why not?,Rachel,Neutral,6,8
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.,Phoebe,Sad,6,9
"Phoebe, Ross sucks!",Monica,Powerful,6,10
"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",Rachel,Powerful,6,11
"Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",Phoebe,Powerful,6,12
"Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",Monica,Powerful,6,14
"Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!",Rachel,Powerful,6,15
You guys. You suck too.,Phoebe,Joyful,6,16
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!,Joey,Mad,7,1
Hang on buddy!,Chandler,Joyful,7,2
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?,Joey,Scared,7,3
I sure did.,Chandler,Powerful,7,4
Why?,Joey,Scared,7,5
"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",Chandler,Peaceful,7,6
"Well, you're amazing.",Joey,Joyful,7,7
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.,Chandler,Joyful,7,8
"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",Joey,Powerful,7,9
"Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",Chandler,Neutral,7,10
"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",Joey,Peaceful,7,11
"Oh, I don't know.",Chandler,Neutral,7,12
"Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.",Joey,Scared,7,13
You mean with Casey.,Chandler,Neutral,7,14
"No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.",Joey,Peaceful,7,15
Or Casey.,Chandler,Powerful,7,16
"No-no, Kathy.",Joey,Neutral,7,17
Could be Casey.,Chandler,Peaceful,7,18
"No. No, Kathy.",Joey,Peaceful,7,19
Consider Casey.,Chandler,Powerful,7,20
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?,Joey,Peaceful,7,21
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!,Chandler,Powerful,7,22
Hey!,Ross,Joyful,8,1
"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",Phoebe,Joyful,8,2
"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?",Ross,Scared,8,3
"Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.",Phoebe,Joyful,8,4
Pheebs...,Ross,Peaceful,8,5
"Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...",Phoebe,Joyful,8,6
"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.",Ross,Sad,8,7
"Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",Phoebe,Sad,8,8
"Yeah, okay.",Ross,Neutral,8,9
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.,Ross,Joyful,9,1
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!,Monica,Joyful,9,2
I kissed Kathy.,Chandler,Powerful,9,3
What?,Ross,Joyful,9,4
Are you serious?,Monica,Scared,9,5
Does Joey know?,Phoebe,Powerful,9,6
"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?",Chandler,Scared,9,7
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.,Monica,Neutral,9,8
"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.",Ross,Sad,9,9
"Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?",Chandler,Sad,9,10
"I think maybe, yeah.",Phoebe,Sad,9,11
He loves you.,Monica,Joyful,9,12
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!,Chandler,Scared,9,13
"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.",Ross,Sad,9,14
"Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",Phoebe,Joyful,9,15
"I know, I remember that!",Rachel,Joyful,9,16
I remember you did.,Monica,Powerful,9,17
God!! What am I gonna do?!,Chandler,Powerful,9,18
"Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.",Rachel,Powerful,9,19
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!,Chandler,Powerful,9,20
Because you do.,Rachel,Peaceful,9,21
"Yeah, I know.",Chandler,Neutral,9,22
"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",Ross,Joyful,9,23
"Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.",Phoebe,Scared,11,1
What?,Monica,Neutral,11,2
"Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",Rachel,Mad,11,3
"Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?",Ross,Scared,11,5
"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",Phoebe,Neutral,11,6
"Yeah, like I could lose it.",Ross,Neutral,11,8

I played bad on purpose guys.,Ross,Joyful,11,10
"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",Monica,Neutral,11,12
"Yeah-no, just that last song.",Ross,Neutral,11,13

I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,Joey,Scared,3,4
Everything? Even the TV?,Ross,Peaceful,3,5
No! I'm putting that in my room.,Joey,Joyful,3,6
"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?",Ross,Neutral,3,7
"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",Joey,Neutral,3,8
"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",Ross,Neutral,3,9
Five years.,Joey,Neutral,3,10
You've sentenced him?!,Ross,Scared,3,11
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.,Joey,Joyful,3,12
"Joey, the guy's your best friend.",Ross,Powerful,3,13
"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.",Joey,Joyful,3,14
"Oh, who? Me?",Ross,Joyful,3,15
Yeah!,Joey,Joyful,3,16
Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?,Ross,Powerful,3,17

All right. But if you weren't my best friend.,Joey,Sad,3,20
"Oh my God, is it really that bad?",Kathy,Powerful,4,1
"I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",Chandler,Sad,4,2
"Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",Joey,Neutral,4,3
"I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.",Gunther,Neutral,4,4

What?!,Chandler,Scared,6,5
"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...",Joey,Sad,6,6
"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?",Chandler,Scared,6,7
"Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.",Joey,Powerful,6,8
"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",Chandler,Sad,6,9
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.,Joey,Mad,6,10
"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",Chandler,Sad,6,12
"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",Joey,Mad,6,13
What?,Chandler,Mad,6,14
"Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!",Joey,Mad,6,15
"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?",Chandler,Sad,6,16
We've got a box.,Joey,Peaceful,6,17
"Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.",Timothy,Neutral,7,1
I was probably waiting for it to open.,Monica,Neutral,7,2
"I gotta tell you, you look great now.",Timothy,Joyful,7,3
You look great too.,Monica,Joyful,7,4
You're an excellent patient!,Timothy,Joyful,7,5

Like a pirate?!,Monica,Scared,7,8
If that helps you.,Timothy,Neutral,7,9
"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.",Monica,Neutral,7,10
I moved back here a couple of months ago.,Timothy,Neutral,7,11
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?,Monica,Neutral,7,12

I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.,Timothy,Neutral,7,15
Oh.,Monica,Sad,7,16
But we broke up.,Timothy,Neutral,7,17
Oh.,Monica,Joyful,7,18
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.,Timothy,Sad,7,19
"Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",Monica,Joyful,7,20
You're not wearing the patch yet.,Timothy,Neutral,7,21

"Oh, he sees her!",Rachel,Joyful,9,1
"Oh, he's catching up to her!",Monica,Joyful,9,2

He's taking her purse!,Ross,Scared,9,4
"Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.",Joey,Scared,9,5
"Oh, there they are!",Phoebe,Joyful,9,6
"All right, get a room.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,8
Okay!,Phoebe,Neutral,1,1
"Come on, no peeking!",Monica,Powerful,1,2
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.,Chandler,Powerful,1,3
"Okayyyyy, open up!",Phoebe,Powerful,1,4
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!,Ross,Joyful,1,6
"Yeah, it's for our catering business!",Phoebe,Joyful,1,7
I think I know that girl.,Joey,Neutral,1,8
"All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.",Monica,Neutral,1,9
No?,Rachel,Neutral,1,10
"No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,11
Oh!,Rachel,Sad,1,12
"And also, we don't know what to do with this.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,13
"Oh yeah, I definitely know her.",Joey,Joyful,1,14
"Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...",Rachel,Powerful,3,1
"Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.",Joanna,Powerful,3,2
"Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...",Rachel,Powerful,3,3
"Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.",Joanna,Powerful,3,4
"God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.",Rachel,Powerful,3,5
"Really? Well, in that case...",Joanna,Scared,3,6
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.,Rachel,Scared,3,7
"That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.",Joanna,Joyful,3,8
Ohh! That's great!,Rachel,Joyful,3,9
"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.",Joanna,Powerful,3,10
Really?!,Rachel,Scared,3,11
"No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.",Joanna,Sad,3,12
"Well, I, umm...",Rachel,Joyful,3,13
"Kidding! God, I feel wild today!",Joanna,Joyful,3,14
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!,Chandler,Joyful,4,1
"Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.",Joey,Peaceful,4,2

Okay.,Joey,Peaceful,4,13
"Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.",Chandler,Sad,4,14

"Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!",Ross,Joyful,4,17
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!",Chandler,Mad,4,18
"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.",Mr.,Powerful,5,1
Thank you.,Rachel,Joyful,5,2
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.,Joanna,Joyful,5,3
"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",Rachel,Mad,5,4
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,Mrs.,Powerful,5,5
"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",Rachel,Joyful,5,6
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!,Joanna,Joyful,5,7
"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",Rachel,Mad,5,8
"Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!",Joanna,Scared,5,9
"Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",Mr.,Powerful,5,10
"Yes, I realize that...",Rachel,Powerful,5,11
"And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",Joanna,Neutral,5,12
I love working with designers!,Rachel,Joyful,5,13
"With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?",Joanna,Scared,5,14

Oh! Do you need me to go with you?,Monica,Joyful,6,7
"No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?",Phoebe,Sad,6,8
Haven't we made this decision?,Monica,Joyful,6,9
"Yeah, all right.",Phoebe,Scared,6,10

"Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.",Monica,Peaceful,6,20
Just give me a chance too...,Allesandro,Powerful,6,21
"Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.",Phoebe,Neutral,6,22

I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!,Allesandro,Mad,7,1
"I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.",Monica,Mad,7,2
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.,Allesandro,Mad,7,3
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!,Monica,Mad,7,4
"Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!",Allesandro,Mad,7,5
"All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",Monica,Powerful,7,6
"Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.",Allesandro,Powerful,7,7
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?,Monica,Mad,7,8
Lebanon.,Allesandro,Scared,7,9
"Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",Monica,Powerful,7,10
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.,Allesandro,Mad,7,11
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.,Joey,Joyful,9,1
"It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.",Ross,Peaceful,9,2
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?,Joey,Neutral,9,3
No! I balanced my checkbook.,Ross,Peaceful,9,4
"Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",Chandler,Powerful,9,5

So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!,Joey,Joyful,9,7
"Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!",Chandler,Scared,9,8
"Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!",Ross,Powerful,9,9
"Well, we could do that!",Joey,Powerful,9,10
There's other stuff too.,Ross,Peaceful,9,11
"We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!",Joey,Peaceful,9,12

It's not like we don't know how to party!!,Ross,Mad,9,17
Yeah! All right? Let's go!,Joey,Joyful,9,18
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?,Chandler,Joyful,9,19
Yeah!!!,Joey,Peaceful,9,20
All right!!,Chandler,Joyful,9,21
"Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?",Ross,Neutral,9,22
"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",Chandler,Peaceful,9,23
Yeah.,Ross,Powerful,9,24
"Well, those were seals, man.",Chandler,Powerful,9,25
"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.",Joey,Neutral,11,1
"Yeah, all right.",Chandler,Neutral,11,2
Okay.,Ross,Neutral,11,3
"So, we're having fun, right?",Joey,Neutral,11,4
Yeah.,Chandler,Neutral,11,5
"We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",Joey,Scared,11,6
I'm kinda beat.,Ross,Neutral,11,7
"Actually, me too.",Chandler,Joyful,11,8
Are you serious?!,Joey,Powerful,11,9
Yeah.,Chandler,Neutral,11,10
Thank God! I'm exhausted!,Joey,Peaceful,11,11
So you guys want coffees?,Gunther,Scared,11,12
"Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.",Joey,Peaceful,11,13
"Yeah, me too.",Ross,Peaceful,11,14
"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",Chandler,Neutral,11,15
"I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",Joey,Neutral,11,16
"I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.",Ross,Sad,11,17
How sad are we?,Ross,Neutral,11,19
"Yeah, I know.",Joey,Joyful,11,20
"Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",Chandler,Scared,11,21
Yeah!,Joey,Neutral,11,22
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,Joey,Joyful,11,23
Yeah!,Chandler,Neutral,11,24
"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",Ross,Joyful,11,25
"We're 29, we're not women.",Joey,Scared,11,26
"Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.",Monica,Scared,12,1
"Okay, I'm hearing.",Phoebe,Powerful,12,2
"I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",Monica,Powerful,12,3
What?!,Phoebe,Joyful,12,4
Or! A bakery delivery person.,Monica,Joyful,12,5
I wa-I wa-I wa...,Phoebe,Neutral,12,6
Pizza?!,Monica,Neutral,12,7
Monica!,Phoebe,Neutral,12,8
"All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.",Monica,Powerful,12,9
No.,Phoebe,Powerful,12,10
"Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.",Monica,Joyful,12,11
No.,Phoebe,Joyful,12,12
"Y'know what, let's do the catering business.",Monica,Joyful,12,13
Really?! Are you sure?,Phoebe,Scared,12,14
"Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.",Monica,Scared,12,15
"Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.",Phoebe,Scared,12,16
Really?!,Monica,Powerful,12,17
"Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.",Phoebe,Powerful,12,18
Thank you.,Monica,Joyful,12,19
"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",Phoebe,Joyful,12,20
"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",Rachel,Neutral,13,1
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!,Mrs.,Joyful,13,2
Heard what?,Rachel,Joyful,13,3
Joanna passed away last night.,Mrs.,Sad,13,4
Oh my God! How?!,Rachel,Sad,13,5
"Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.",Mrs.,Scared,13,6
"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",Rachel,Sad,13,7
I know!,Mrs.,Powerful,13,8
"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.",Rachel,Sad,13,9
I didn't realize that she was so close.,Mrs.,Sad,13,10
"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.",Rachel,Peaceful,13,11
"No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.",Mrs.,Sad,13,12
"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?",Rachel,Sad,13,13
"No, I'm sorry. I have to go.",Mrs.,Sad,13,14
Good morning!,Sophie,Joyful,13,15
"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...",Rachel,Neutral,13,16
I sure did!,Sophie,Joyful,13,17
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!,Phoebe,Powerful,1,1
Oh I know!!,Frank,Joyful,1,2
"You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?",Phoebe,Scared,1,3
"'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...",Frank,Sad,1,4
"Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?",Phoebe,Scared,1,5
"We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, ""Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!",Frank,Joyful,1,6
"Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?",Phoebe,Joyful,1,7
"Uhh, yeah.",Frank,Neutral,1,8
"We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.",Alice,Joyful,1,9
"See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.",Frank,Neutral,1,10
"And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.",Alice,Neutral,1,11
"Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.",Frank,Powerful,1,12
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.,Phoebe,Joyful,1,13
It's open! Come in!,Phoebe,Peaceful,5,1
Hi!,Phoebe,Neutral,5,2
Hi!,Phoebe,Joyful,5,3
"I'm sorry, I'm late.",Phoebe,Scared,5,4
"Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.",Phoebe,Joyful,5,5
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.,Phoebe,Scared,5,6
"No, I was working on my pottery.",Phoebe,Joyful,5,7
"Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.",Phoebe,Scared,5,8
"Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.",Phoebe,Powerful,5,9
"Ooh, erotiery!",Phoebe,Scared,5,10
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...,Phoebe,Scared,5,11
Okay.,Phoebe,Peaceful,5,12
"I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.",Phoebe,Scared,5,13
Why not?,Phoebe,Scared,5,14
"Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,",Phoebe,Scared,5,15
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.,Phoebe,Scared,5,16
"No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.",Phoebe,Scared,5,17
"Oh, I get a puppy!!",Phoebe,Joyful,5,18
"Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.",Phoebe,Joyful,5,19
Why?,Phoebe,Scared,5,20
"I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.",Phoebe,Joyful,5,21
Okay.,Phoebe,Peaceful,5,22
"I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.",Phoebe,Powerful,5,23
"All right, I'm sorry.",Phoebe,Sad,5,24
"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.",Joey,Neutral,6,1
You mean Dr. Geller?,Tour,Neutral,6,2
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.,Joey,Powerful,6,3
"Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.",Tour,Peaceful,6,4
"Well, how-how come?",Joey,Powerful,6,5
That's just the way it is.,Tour,Joyful,6,6
That's crazy.,Joey,Joyful,6,7
"Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!",Tour,Joyful,6,8
"I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.",Joey,Peaceful,6,9
"That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.",Ross,Peaceful,6,10
"Op, this is saved. Gift shop.",Tour,Joyful,6,12
"Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.",Ross,Sad,7,1
"It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?",Joey,Powerful,7,2
"But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.",Ross,Neutral,7,3
Whatever.,Joey,Mad,7,4
"It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?",Ross,Joyful,7,5
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.,Monica,Sad,7,6
"Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.",Joey,Peaceful,7,7
"Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.",Rachel,Sad,7,8
"Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.",Older,Scared,9,1
"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.",Ross,Joyful,9,2
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.,Joey,Powerful,9,3
"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!",Ross,Powerful,9,4
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!,Joey,Powerful,9,5
"I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.",Another,Peaceful,9,6
"All right, there you go!",Ross,Peaceful,9,7
"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!",Joey,Joyful,9,8
"I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.",Older,Powerful,9,9
"Okay, good-good for you.",Ross,Mad,9,10
"I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!",Tour,Peaceful,9,11
"Wow, Rhonda.",Ross,Sad,9,12
I'm Scott.,Another,Powerful,9,13
"Yeah, okay, Scott!",Ross,Peaceful,9,14
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.,Another,Scared,9,15
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?,Monica,Neutral,11,1
It depends on who asked.,Rachel,Neutral,11,2
What if I asked?,Monica,Neutral,11,3
"Oh, Mon, sure.",Rachel,Powerful,11,4
Really?,Monica,Scared,11,5
Yes. You're not asking are you?,Rachel,Powerful,11,6
No.,Monica,Neutral,11,7
Yes! Totally!,Rachel,Joyful,11,8
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!,Kathy,Joyful,11,10
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!,Rachel,Mad,1,1
"Boy, you are really not a morning person.",Monica,Neutral,1,2
"BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!",Rachel,Mad,1,3
What is that noise?,Rachel,Neutral,1,5
You!,Chandler,Neutral,1,6
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.,Joey,Neutral,1,7
What kind of changes?,Monica,Neutral,1,8
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.,Chandler,Neutral,1,9
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.,Dr.,Powerful,3,1
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.,Phoebe,Joyful,3,2
"Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.",Frank,Peaceful,3,3
"Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.",Dr.,Powerful,3,4
"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?""",Phoebe,Scared,3,5
"Um-hmm, five actually.",Dr.,Powerful,3,6
"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",Phoebe,Scared,3,7
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.,Dr.,Powerful,3,8
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!,Phoebe,Scared,3,9
"Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?",Frank,Mad,3,10
"Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.",Alice,Peaceful,3,11
"Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",Phoebe,Peaceful,3,12
"Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.",Frank,Peaceful,3,13
"Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.",Alice,Peaceful,3,14
"Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?",Phoebe,Scared,3,15
"No, I'm sorry.",Dr.,Peaceful,3,16
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!,Phoebe,Mad,3,17
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.,Frank,Joyful,3,18
I can't find garbage bags!,Monica,Joyful,9,1
"Oh, I think I saw some in here.",Rachel,Powerful,9,2
What is it?!,Monica,Peaceful,9,4
"I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.",Rachel,Sad,9,5
I can't believe we're living here!,Monica,Scared,9,6
"Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!",Chandler,Joyful,1,1
People can hear you.,Ross,Scared,1,2
I know!!,Chandler,Joyful,1,3
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?,Chandler,Joyful,1,5
Yeah.,Ross,Neutral,1,6
Hi!,Kathy's,Joyful,1,8
Hi!,Kathy,Joyful,1,9
That is one good looking man!,Ross,Joyful,1,10
"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",Chandler,Joyful,1,11
"Sooo, you've been doing this long?",Kathy's,Joyful,1,12
"No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.",Kathy,Powerful,1,13
"Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.",Kathy's,Joyful,1,15
Dude!,Ross,Neutral,1,16
Is that an expensive blouse?,Kathy's,Joyful,1,17
If you want it to be.,Kathy,Powerful,1,18
Here's your girlfriend's button.,Ross,Neutral,1,20
"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,1
"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",Monica,Peaceful,2,2
"Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.",Phoebe,Peaceful,2,3
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.",Monica,Joyful,2,5
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.,Rachel,Joyful,2,6
"Oh my God, are you out of a job?",Monica,Scared,2,7
"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",Rachel,Sad,2,8
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?,Phoebe,Powerful,2,9
Uh-huh.,Rachel,Peaceful,2,10
That sounds great!,Phoebe,Joyful,2,11
Hey!,Joey,Neutral,2,12
"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",Monica,Mad,2,13
There's gravy?,Joey,Powerful,2,14
"If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.",Monica,Mad,2,15
What are you doing?,Monica,Powerful,2,17
I think I left a donut up here.,Joey,Powerful,2,18
Hey!,Ross,Neutral,3,1
Hey!,Phoebe,Neutral,3,2
Hey!,Joey,Peaceful,3,3
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?,Phoebe,Neutral,3,4
"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.",Ross,Joyful,3,5
"Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",Chandler,Powerful,3,6
That's a good idea for a business!,Phoebe,Joyful,3,7
"I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, ""So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?"" And she'll go, ""No-no-no, it's Chandler."" And he'll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""",Chandler,Peaceful,3,8
That-that is a good trick.,Joey,Joyful,3,9
"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",Chandler,Mad,3,10
"Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.",Joey,Neutral,3,11
"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",Ross,Neutral,3,12
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.,Joey,Neutral,3,13
Yeah.,Ross,Neutral,3,14
"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",Phoebe,Neutral,3,15
They're not a couple!,Ross,Neutral,3,16
"Oh-okay, I get the game now.",Phoebe,Neutral,3,17
"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",Joey,Scared,3,18
Oh yeah!,Ross,Neutral,3,19
"Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.",Joey,Neutral,3,20
Really?,Chandler,Scared,3,21
"Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",Joey,Sad,3,22
No.,Ross,Neutral,3,23
Noooo!!,Joey,Neutral,3,24
"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",Chandler,Powerful,4,1
"Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.",Ross,Scared,4,2
"Yeah, I know but...",Chandler,Sad,4,3
"Oh no-no-no, I'm there.",Ross,Peaceful,4,4
Hey!,Monica,Neutral,4,5
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?,Joey,Joyful,4,6
You made pancakes?,Monica,Peaceful,4,7
Yep! Grab a plate.,Joey,Joyful,4,8
Okay.,Monica,Peaceful,4,9
"No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.",Joey,Mad,4,10
"Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.",Chandler,Peaceful,4,11
"Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",Joey,Powerful,4,12
Oh yeah!,Ross,Powerful,4,13
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",Monica,Peaceful,4,14
"Oh yeah, who's playing?",Joey,Mad,4,15
The players.,Monica,Mad,4,16
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,Ross,Peaceful,4,17
"Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.",Monica,Joyful,4,18
"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",Joey,Peaceful,4,19
Oh.,Phoebe,Joyful,4,20
"Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",Rachel,Scared,5,1
"In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.",Stephen,Peaceful,5,2
Hi!,Rachel,Joyful,5,4
"Hi, I'm Joshua.",Joshua,Neutral,5,5
"Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",Rachel,Neutral,5,6
"Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...",Joshua,Sad,5,7
"Oh, I'm so sorry.",Rachel,Sad,5,8
"Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.",Joshua,Sad,5,10
"Well, at least that's a great suit.",Rachel,Peaceful,5,11

Okay.,Rachel,Neutral,5,13
"Rachel, you needed to speak to me?",Stephen,Powerful,5,14
"No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.",Rachel,Peaceful,5,15

"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",Chandler,Peaceful,9,6
How might you be wrong?,Ross,Scared,9,7
"Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?",Chandler,Peaceful,9,8
"Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",Joey,Peaceful,9,9
"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",Chandler,Joyful,9,10
That's all you're basing this on?,Ross,Scared,9,11
"That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",Chandler,Peaceful,9,12
"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",Joey,Scared,9,13

I thought I was making him filet mignon?,Rachel,Neutral,4,7

"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",Rachel,Mad,4,9
Hey!,Ross,Neutral,7,1

"I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.",Carol,Joyful,7,14
"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?",Ross,Joyful,7,15

"Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",Rachel,Sad,5,6
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.,Monica,Sad,5,7
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,Rachel,Scared,5,8
"Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",Monica,Joyful,5,9

Hi! Phoebe.,Rachel,Joyful,10,2
Hi Phoebe.,Monica,Joyful,10,3
"I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.",Phoebe,Sad,10,4
No we...,Rachel,Scared,10,5
Hormones.,Monica,Scared,10,6
"...hormones, yeah.",Rachel,Scared,10,7
"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.",Phoebe,Joyful,10,8
"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?",Monica,Joyful,10,9
"Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?",Phoebe,Joyful,10,10
"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.",Rachel,Joyful,10,11
Oh!,Phoebe,Joyful,10,12
"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...",Rachel,Neutral,10,13
"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",Phoebe,Peaceful,10,14
"Well, h-how is this like that?",Rachel,Sad,10,15
"Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...",Phoebe,Sad,10,16
"I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...",Rachel,Sad,10,17
"Alrighty, here come the water works.",Phoebe,Peaceful,10,18
"Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?",Joey,Mad,11,1
Hey guys!,Ross,Joyful,11,2
Hey!,Chandler,Joyful,11,3
Hey...,Joey,Neutral,11,4
"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...",Ross,Joyful,11,5
"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!",Joey,Scared,11,6
"Yeah, right!",Ross,Joyful,11,7
"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...",Joey,Peaceful,11,8
"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",Ross,Powerful,11,9
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",Chandler,Powerful,11,10
"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",Ross,Powerful,11,11
"So you might say, it's a magic ring.",Chandler,Powerful,11,12
"Yeah, the stripper stole it.",Joey,Joyful,11,13
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!,Ross,Scared,11,14
"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man.""",Chandler,Scared,11,15
"All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!",Ross,Scared,11,16
"Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!",Joey,Scared,11,17
Not on you! On the stripper!,Ross,Mad,11,18
"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.",Joey,Joyful,11,19
"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!",Ross,Peaceful,11,20
"I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, ""If I bothered them again they'd call the police."" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!""",Joey,Joyful,11,21
"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!",Ross,Scared,11,22
"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...",Joey,Sad,11,23
"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?",Chandler,Powerful,11,24
"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!",Joey,Joyful,11,25
Here's your tea Phoebe.,Monica,Peaceful,12,1

"Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!",Rachel,Joyful,12,13
"No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",Phoebe,Joyful,12,14
"Rachel, get the book! The book!",Monica,Peaceful,12,15
Okay! Okay! Here!,Rachel,Scared,12,16
The Bible?!,Monica,Joyful,12,17
I don't know!,Rachel,Joyful,12,18
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.",Joey,Joyful,13,1

We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,Ross,Mad,13,13

Marry me.,Chandler,Joyful,13,15
If anything should happen to him...,Joey,Scared,16,1
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.,Ross,Powerful,16,2
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!,Joey,Mad,16,3
"He will, Joe.",Chandler,Powerful,16,4
"Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.",Joey,Peaceful,16,5
"I'm so worried about him, y'know?",Joey,Sad,16,7
Somebody lose a ring?,The,Powerful,16,8
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!,Ross,Powerful,16,9
H-h-h-how's the duck?,Joey,Scared,16,10

"Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",Joey,Joyful,16,12

"No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!",Joey,Powerful,16,14
"Hey, come on, it's not your fault.",Chandler,Scared,16,15
"Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.",Joey,Peaceful,16,16
"No, you should.",Chandler,Joyful,16,17

"Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.",Ross,Powerful,16,19

What a baby.,Chandler,Joyful,16,25
Total wuss!,Ross,Sad,16,26
"Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!",Monica,Joyful,1,1
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.,Chandler,Peaceful,1,2
What do you got there?,Joey,Powerful,1,3
"Condoms, dude!",Chandler,Peaceful,1,4
How come the writing is in Spanish?,Joey,Neutral,1,5
Don't read my condoms!,Chandler,Neutral,1,6
"Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!",Monica,Joyful,1,8
"Who are you saying ""check"" too?",Rachel,Peaceful,1,9
"Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.",Monica,Peaceful,1,10
"Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.",Phoebe,Joyful,1,11
Hey!,Ross,Joyful,1,12
Hey!,Monica,Peaceful,1,13
Hey! Are you ready yet?,Ross,Peaceful,1,14
Yep! You got the tickets?,Monica,Neutral,1,15

Ohh!!,Joey,Powerful,1,22
There it is.,Chandler,Neutral,1,23
Come on! Do something!,Joey,Mad,3,1

"Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.",Joey,Neutral,3,3

"It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.",Joey,Joyful,3,5
"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!",Chandler,Mad,3,6
I got it! Here we go.,Joey,Neutral,3,7
"Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?",Chandler,Mad,3,8
"Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!",Joey,Mad,3,9
"...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...",Emily,Scared,4,1
"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?",Ross,Powerful,4,2
"Well, up yours too!",Emily,Peaceful,4,3
What?!,Ross,Scared,4,4
"Oh, that's not what it means?",Emily,Scared,4,5
No! No! That's-that's time-out!,Ross,Sad,4,6
Sorry.,Emily,Joyful,4,7
"Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.",Ross,Peaceful,4,8
Chicken Kiev?,Monica,Scared,4,9
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?,Ross,Peaceful,4,10
"Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!",Monica,Powerful,4,11
"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.",Ross,Joyful,4,12
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!,Emily,Joyful,4,13
It's nice.,Monica,Joyful,4,14
Oh. Oh.,Emily,Joyful,4,15
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?,Emily,Powerful,4,17
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.,Ross,Peaceful,4,18
How's it gonna be all right?!,Emily,Powerful,4,19
"Uh-huh, I see that.",Ross,Peaceful,4,20
"Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.",Monica,Powerful,4,21
What? What?,Ross,Scared,4,22
They tore it down a few days early.,Monica,Joyful,4,23
"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",Joey,Joyful,6,1
"I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.",Chandler,Joyful,6,2
Really? To what?,Joey,Neutral,6,3
To Put the Camera Away!!!,Chandler,Mad,6,4
"Man, you are Westminster Crabby.",Joey,Mad,6,5
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.,Monica,Joyful,7,1
Oowww!!,Monica,Mad,7,3
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!,Dressmaker,Neutral,7,4
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!,Emily,Mad,7,5
"You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!",Monica,Joyful,7,6
"I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!",Emily,Joyful,7,7
"But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.",Monica,Joyful,7,8
"Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!",Monica,Scared,7,10
Oh. Oh.,Phoebe,Scared,8,1
"Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?",Rachel,Scared,8,2
"Oh, no. Oh, nothing.",Phoebe,Powerful,8,3
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.,Rachel,Powerful,8,4
"Okay, I have a wedgie.",Phoebe,Joyful,8,5
"Okay, that is all you.",Rachel,Powerful,8,6
"So-so, what do you want for lunch?",Phoebe,Powerful,8,7
"Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.",Rachel,Powerful,8,8
"Yeah, I do. What's the matter?",Phoebe,Scared,8,9
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,Rachel,Scared,8,10
"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...",Phoebe,Neutral,8,11
Still in love with?!,Rachel,Scared,8,12
Yeah!,Phoebe,Peaceful,8,13
I'm not in love with Ross!,Rachel,Mad,8,14
"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",Phoebe,Scared,8,15
"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!",Rachel,Mad,8,16
We thought you knew!,Phoebe,Peaceful,8,17
We?!,Rachel,Scared,8,18
"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",Phoebe,Powerful,8,19
You all know? Does Ross know?,Rachel,Scared,8,20
"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.",Phoebe,Scared,8,21
"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!",Rachel,Mad,8,22
"Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."" Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay.""",Phoebe,Powerful,8,23
What?!,Rachel,Scared,8,25
"Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!",Phoebe,Powerful,8,26
Hey!,Joey,Neutral,9,1
"So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...",The,Neutral,9,2
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?,Joey,Joyful,9,3
"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",Chandler,Scared,9,4
"Well, I like it. Here you go.",Joey,Powerful,9,5
"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?",Chandler,Powerful,9,6
"Oh, I embarrass you?",Joey,Joyful,9,7
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?,Chandler,Mad,9,8
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!,The,Scared,9,9
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,Chandler,Mad,9,10
They're all tourists.,The,Peaceful,9,11
"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",Chandler,Mad,9,12
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,Joey,Powerful,9,13
Good choice.,The,Powerful,9,14
Thanks.,Joey,Joyful,9,15
"Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!",Chandler,Mad,9,16
"How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.",Joey,Sad,9,18
Hello?,Emily,Neutral,10,1
"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",Ross,Joyful,10,2
We don't have to.,Emily,Sad,10,3
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,Ross,Neutral,10,4
"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.",Emily,Sad,10,5
She said what?,Ross,Neutral,10,6
"She said, ""If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""",Emily,Scared,10,7
"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.",Ross,Mad,10,8
"I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.",Emily,Joyful,10,9
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,Ross,Scared,10,10
"Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.",Emily,Scared,10,11
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.,Ross,Scared,10,12
So what are you saying? It's now or never?,Emily,Mad,10,13
No. I'm saying it's now.,Ross,Joyful,10,14
Or?,Emily,Scared,10,15
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,Ross,Joyful,10,16
"It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!",Emily,Mad,10,17
"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-",Ross,Scared,10,18
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!,Phoebe,Joyful,13,1
"Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.",Rachel,Joyful,13,2
"Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.",Phoebe,Sad,13,3
I'll get it.,Phoebe,Neutral,13,5
Hello.,Phoebe,Neutral,13,7
"Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!",Joey,Joyful,13,8
"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.",Phoebe,Joyful,13,9
"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",Joey,Powerful,13,10
"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",Phoebe,Peaceful,13,11
"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.",Joey,Sad,13,12
So you're not homesick yet?,Phoebe,Sad,13,13
"No, I don't think so.",Joey,Neutral,13,14
"All right, the seven of us miss you.",Phoebe,Sad,13,15
Who's seven?,Joey,Powerful,13,16
"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...",Phoebe,Sad,13,17
"Ahh, the babies miss me?",Joey,Sad,13,18
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.,Phoebe,Powerful,13,19
"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!",Phoebe,Peaceful,13,21
What? You ordered pizza without me?!,Joey,Neutral,13,22
"Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.",Phoebe,Joyful,13,23
Two pizzas?!,Joey,Joyful,13,24
"Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.",Phoebe,Sad,13,25
"Wait, well, where did you get it from?!",Joey,Powerful,13,26
"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!",Emily,Mad,14,1
You'll see.,Monica,Neutral,14,2
"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.",Emily,Mad,14,3
Oh God.,Emily,Powerful,14,5
"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...",Ross,Joyful,14,6
"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.",Monica,Powerful,14,7
"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.",Ross,Peaceful,14,8
It's perfect.,Emily,Joyful,14,9
"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...",Ross,Scared,14,10
Well then we'll get wet.,Emily,Joyful,14,11
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.,Monica,Sad,14,12
Pheebs?,Rachel,Neutral,15,1
Yeah?,Phoebe,Joyful,15,2
Do you remember where the duck food is?,Rachel,Powerful,15,3
"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?",Phoebe,Peaceful,15,4
Because I'm going to London.,Rachel,Joyful,15,5
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?,Phoebe,Peaceful,15,6
"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.",Rachel,Peaceful,15,7
"But what about all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?",Phoebe,Scared,15,8
"Yeah, that didn't work.",Rachel,Peaceful,15,9
"I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!",Phoebe,Scared,15,10
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",Rachel,Peaceful,15,11
"That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.""",Phoebe,Joyful,15,12
Ohh-Do you think he will?!,Rachel,Scared,15,13
"No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.",Phoebe,Powerful,15,14
"Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, ""I do.""",Rachel,Powerful,15,15
"I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.",Phoebe,Joyful,15,16
The Waltham Residence.,Housekeeper,Neutral,1,1
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.,Phoebe,Neutral,1,2
"This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.",Housekeeper,Peaceful,1,3
What are you saying?!,Phoebe,Powerful,1,4
"Now, let us try that again, shall we?",Housekeeper,Peaceful,1,5

"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.",Ross,Powerful,7,4
"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",Joey,Joyful,7,5
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.,Ross,Scared,7,6

"Oh, which museum?",Phoebe,Powerful,1,10
"No, answer his.",Phoebe,Peaceful,1,11
"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",Ross,Joyful,1,12
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,Chandler,Neutral,1,13
"No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",Ross,Peaceful,1,14
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.,Chandler,Peaceful,1,15
"Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?",Joey,Powerful,1,16
"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!",Chandler,Scared,3,1

"Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?",Mike,Neutral,3,10
"Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?",Drew,Powerful,3,11
"Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",Chandler,Joyful,3,12
"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.",Mike,Joyful,3,13
"Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!",Chandler,Joyful,3,14
"Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.",Ross,Joyful,5,1
Oh yeah! With who?,Chandler,Scared,5,2
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,Ross,Peaceful,5,3
Yeah.,Chandler,Powerful,5,4
"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.",Ross,Peaceful,5,5
"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",Phoebe,Joyful,5,6
"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.",Ross,Peaceful,5,7
Hey!,Joey,Joyful,5,8
Hey!,Ross,Joyful,5,9
"Hey, man!",Chandler,Peaceful,5,10

"Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?",Rachel,Scared,7,5
"Ummmmmmmm, no.",Chandler,Scared,7,6
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!,Rachel,Mad,7,7
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.,Chandler,Neutral,7,8
"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.",Rachel,Mad,7,9
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",Monica,Joyful,8,1
"Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",Joey,Scared,8,2
"Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",A,Peaceful,8,3
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!,Joey,Joyful,8,4
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",The,Scared,8,5
"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?",Monica,Mad,8,6
Because we can remember them.,The,Neutral,8,7
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,Monica,Mad,8,8
"Well, sure, that too.",The,Powerful,8,9
"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...",Monica,Peaceful,8,10
Can't hear you!,The,Powerful,8,11
"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",Monica,Mad,8,12
No ma'am.,Joey,Joyful,8,13
"Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?",The,Neutral,8,14
What the hell happened?!,Monica,Scared,9,1
"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!""",Joey,Sad,9,2
"Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!",Monica,Mad,9,3
"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.",Joey,Scared,9,4
What kinda things have you been saying?,Monica,Neutral,9,5
"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",Joey,Neutral,9,6
"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...",Phoebe,Joyful,10,1

"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.",Ross,Neutral,10,9
"So, did you pick one yet?",Phoebe,Neutral,10,10
"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.",Ross,Neutral,10,11
"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!",Phoebe,Neutral,10,12
"Y'know, you're right. Thank you.",Ross,Neutral,10,13
"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",Phoebe,Neutral,10,14
Prague?,Chandler,Neutral,10,15
There's sooo much you don't know.,Phoebe,Neutral,10,16
"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",Rachel,Neutral,11,1
I did! I absolutely did!,Chandler,Scared,11,2
You idiot!!,Rachel,Mad,11,3
"I'm sure you're right, but why?",Chandler,Scared,11,4
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,Rachel,Mad,11,5
"Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.",Chandler,Sad,11,6
"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",Rachel,Mad,11,7

"Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!",Rachel,Mad,11,9

Well that's not true.,The,Powerful,13,10
"I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...",Monica,Scared,13,11
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!,Joey,Powerful,13,12

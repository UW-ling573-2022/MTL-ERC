"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",Ross,Mad,4,0
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.,Joey,Neutral,4,2
It's a beautiful thing.,Chandler,Joyful,4,3
What's this?,Joey,Neutral,4,4
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.,Chandler,Neutral,4,5
Which goes where?,Joey,Neutral,4,6
I have no idea.,Chandler,Scared,4,7
Done with the bookcase!,Joey,Joyful,4,9
All finished!,Chandler,Joyful,4,10
"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.",Ross,Sad,4,11
"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.",Joey,Mad,4,12
"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.",Chandler,Scared,4,13
"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?",Joey,Neutral,4,14
You guys.,Ross,Sad,4,15
"Oh, God.",Chandler,Sad,4,16
You got screwed.,Joey,Mad,4,17
Oh my God!,Chandler,Mad,4,18
Oh my God!,Monica,Mad,5,0
"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?",Paul,Sad,5,1
"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",Monica,Sad,5,2
"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-",Paul,Powerful,5,3
-leg?,Monica,Joyful,5,4
"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.",Paul,Joyful,5,5
"You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.",Monica,Powerful,5,6
"Ooh, steer clear of you.",Paul,Peaceful,5,7
That's right.,Monica,Powerful,5,8
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!,Ross,Sad,7,0
Shut up!,Joey,Mad,7,1
You must stop!,Chandler,Mad,7,2
That only took me an hour.,Ross,Sad,7,3
"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!",Chandler,Sad,7,4
"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",Ross,Scared,7,5
"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",Joey,Powerful,7,6
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,Ross,Scared,7,7
Stay out of my freezer!,Chandler,Mad,7,8
"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...",Paul,Sad,8,0
"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",Monica,Neutral,8,1
"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.",Paul,Sad,8,2
"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?",Monica,Neutral,8,3
Isn't there?,Paul,Scared,8,4
"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?",Monica,Neutral,8,5
"Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.",Paul,Sad,8,6
"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",Monica,Neutral,8,7
It's okay...,Paul,Sad,8,8
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?,Monica,Neutral,8,9
Two years.,Paul,Neutral,8,10
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!,Monica,Joyful,8,11
"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?",Paul,Neutral,8,12
"...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",Monica,Neutral,8,13
"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",Ross,Peaceful,10,0
"Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,",Joey,Scared,10,1
"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.",Chandler,Joyful,10,2
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.,Joey,Peaceful,10,3
"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?",Ross,Sad,10,4
"Hey, Monica!",Franny,Joyful,12,0
"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?",Monica,Neutral,12,1
"You had sex, didn't you?",Franny,Neutral,12,2
How do you do that?,Monica,Neutral,12,3
"Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?",Franny,Mad,12,4
You know Paul?,Monica,Neutral,12,5
"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.",Franny,Neutral,12,6
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,Monica,Neutral,12,7
"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.",Franny,Neutral,12,8
Of course it was a line!,Joey,Mad,13,0
"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",Monica,Mad,13,1
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,Ross,Neutral,13,2
I hate men! I hate men!,Monica,Mad,13,3
"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",Phoebe,Peaceful,13,4
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,Monica,Mad,13,5
"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.",Phoebe,Peaceful,13,6
"I just thought he was nice, y'know?",Monica,Sad,13,7
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,Joey,Joyful,13,8
Guess what?,Rachel,Neutral,13,10
You got a job?,Ross,Neutral,13,11
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,Rachel,Mad,13,12
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.,Chandler,Neutral,13,13
"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",Rachel,Joyful,13,14
"Oh, how well you know me...",Chandler,Neutral,13,15
"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",Rachel,Joyful,13,16
How'd you pay for them?,Monica,Neutral,13,17
"Uh, credit card.",Rachel,Neutral,13,18
And who pays for that?,Monica,Neutral,13,19
Um... my... father.,Rachel,Neutral,13,20
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,Joey,Neutral,15,0
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...,Phoebe,Joyful,15,1
What? I-I said you had a-,Monica,Scared,15,2
What I said you had...,Phoebe,Joyful,15,3
Would you stop?,Monica,Mad,15,4
"Oh, was I doing it again?",Phoebe,Neutral,15,5
Yes!,#ALL#,Mad,15,6
"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.",Monica,Peaceful,15,7
"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.",Joey,Joyful,15,8
There's an image.,Ross,Neutral,15,9
Would anybody like more coffee?,Rachel,Peaceful,15,10
"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?",Chandler,Scared,15,11
I'm just serving it.,Rachel,Neutral,15,12
"Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.",#ALL#,Joyful,15,13
"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.",Chandler,Peaceful,15,14
"Ahh, miss? More coffee?",Customer,Scared,15,15
"Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.",Rachel,Mad,15,16
"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-",Chandler,Neutral,15,17
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.,Ross,Neutral,1,0
Oooh!,#ALL#,Joyful,1,2
W-wait. What is that?,Monica,Scared,1,3
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?,Ross,Joyful,1,4
"No, no, I don't.",Monica,Scared,1,5
"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?",Rachel,Joyful,1,6
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.,Ross,Neutral,1,7
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,Phoebe,Neutral,1,8
"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",Chandler,Joyful,1,9
"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?",Monica,Neutral,1,10
"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...",Ross,Neutral,1,11
Why don't you just get a roommate?,Monica,Neutral,1,12
"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.",Ross,Sad,1,13
"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.",David,Powerful,4,0
"Okay, alright, I have a question, then.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,1
Yuh.,David,Neutral,4,2
"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",Phoebe,Neutral,4,3
"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.",David,Joyful,4,4
Sure.,Phoebe,Neutral,4,5
"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.",David,Scared,4,6
"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",Phoebe,Joyful,4,7
Rrrreally.,David,Neutral,4,8
"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.",Phoebe,Joyful,4,9
...Now? Now?,David,Scared,4,10
"Oh yeah, right now.",Phoebe,Powerful,4,11
"Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.",David,Neutral,4,12
"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.",Phoebe,Neutral,4,13
"Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?",David,Joyful,4,14
I can hop.,Phoebe,Joyful,4,15
Hello?,Phoebe,Scared,6,0
Hey!,David,Joyful,6,1
Hi.,Phoebe,Neutral,6,2
Hi! What-what're you doing here?,David,Joyful,6,3
"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!",Phoebe,Joyful,6,4
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.,Max,Sad,6,5
"Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?",Phoebe,Joyful,6,6
"Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'",Max,Mad,6,7
"Thank you, Max. Thank you.",David,Peaceful,6,8
So-so you're really not going?,Phoebe,Neutral,6,9
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.,David,Neutral,6,10
Oh don't do that.,Phoebe,Scared,6,11
Please.,David,Neutral,6,12
Oh no no.,Phoebe,Neutral,6,13
"No, but I'm asking-",David,Neutral,6,14
"Oh, but I can't do that-",Phoebe,Neutral,6,15
"No, but I can't-",David,Scared,6,16
"It's your thing, and-",Phoebe,Neutral,6,17
-make the decision-,David,Neutral,6,18
"Okay, um, stay.",Phoebe,Neutral,6,19
Stay.,David,Neutral,6,20
Stay.,Phoebe,Neutral,6,21
Getting so good at that!,Phoebe,Joyful,6,23
It was Max's stuff.,David,Peaceful,6,24
Ross kissed me.,Rachel,Joyful,1,1
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",Monica,Joyful,1,2
It was unbelievable!,Rachel,Joyful,1,3
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",Monica,Joyful,1,4
"Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?",Phoebe,Joyful,1,5
"Oh, it ended very well.",Rachel,Neutral,1,6
Oh.,Phoebe,Neutral,1,7
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.,Monica,Neutral,1,8
"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?",Phoebe,Joyful,1,9
"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.",Rachel,Joyful,1,10
"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?",Phoebe,Neutral,1,11
"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.",Rachel,Joyful,1,12
Ohhhh.,Monica,Joyful,1,13
"This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.",Mr.,Joyful,4,1
"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.",Monica,Neutral,4,2
Mockolate.,Mr.,Neutral,4,3
I'm sorry?,Monica,Scared,4,4
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,Mr.,Neutral,4,5
Ohh.,Monica,Scared,4,6
"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",Mr.,Powerful,4,7
All right. Mmm-mmm.,Monica,Mad,4,8
Yeah?,Mr.,Neutral,4,9
"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.",Monica,Mad,4,10
"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.",Mr.,Powerful,4,11
Mmm-mmm.,Monica,Mad,4,12
"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",Mr.,Powerful,4,13
Wow.,Monica,Neutral,4,14
Aren't you going to swallow that?,Mr.,Neutral,4,15
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.,Monica,Mad,4,16
"Yeah, isn't that great?",Mr.,Powerful,4,17
Mmm.,Monica,Mad,4,18
"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?",Mr.,Powerful,4,19
"Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.",Monica,Joyful,4,20
Really?,Mr.,Powerful,4,21
"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.",Monica,Joyful,4,22
How about Mockolate mousse?,Monica,Neutral,5,1
"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.",Phoebe,Mad,5,2
"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?",Monica,Neutral,5,3
What makes it pilgrim?,Phoebe,Neutral,5,4
We'll put buckles on it.,Monica,Joyful,5,5
Hey.,Rachel,Neutral,5,6
Hey.,Phoebe,Neutral,5,7
Hey.,Monica,Neutral,5,8
"Did uh, Ross call?",Rachel,Neutral,5,9
"No, I'm sorry.",Monica,Sad,5,10
"Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.""",Rachel,Mad,5,11
"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.",Phoebe,Powerful,5,12
"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",Ross,Scared,6,1
"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",Chandler,Mad,6,2
"Hey, here's a thought, Ross.",Joey,Peaceful,6,3
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.,Chandler,Mad,6,4
"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",Joey,Joyful,6,5
"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.",Chandler,Peaceful,6,6
Can't we just use a pen?,Ross,Neutral,6,7
"No, Amish boy.",Chandler,Joyful,6,8
"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",Joey,Neutral,6,9
"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",Ross,Peaceful,6,10
You could say that.,Joey,Neutral,6,11
"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",Ross,Peaceful,6,12
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,Chandler,Joyful,6,13
I don't know.,Ross,Neutral,6,14
"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",Joey,Joyful,6,15
"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?",Chandler,Neutral,6,16
She's not Rachel.,Ross,Sad,6,17
"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",Monica,Neutral,7,1
Oh my god.,Rachel,Mad,7,2
Oh my god good?,Monica,Scared,7,3
"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.",Rachel,Mad,7,4
"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!",Phoebe,Sad,7,5
"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.",Chandler,Joyful,9,1
"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",Monica,Powerful,9,2
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,Phoebe,Scared,9,3
"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",Joey,Neutral,9,4
What?,Phoebe,Neutral,9,5
What?,Monica,Neutral,9,6
"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.",Chandler,Joyful,9,7
This was your idea?,Monica,Neutral,9,8
What were you thinking?,Phoebe,Neutral,9,9
"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",Chandler,Peaceful,9,10
Yeah. You!,Monica,Neutral,9,11
"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",Chandler,Scared,9,12
"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.",Phoebe,Neutral,9,13
"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!",Ross,Scared,10,1
"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.",Rachel,Mad,10,2
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.,Ross,Neutral,10,3
Not interested.,Rachel,Mad,10,4
"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.",Ross,Neutral,10,5
Number six: the way you smell.,Ross,Peaceful,10,6
"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?",Joey,Peaceful,10,7
"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?",Ross,Neutral,10,8
"Oh, yeah, I do.",Joey,Joyful,10,9
What are you doing out there?,Chandler,Neutral,10,10
"I am, uh, I am...",Ross,Scared,10,11
"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",Monica,Peaceful,10,12
"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.",Ross,Scared,10,13
No.,Rachel,Mad,10,14
No?,Ross,Scared,10,15
That's what I said.,Rachel,Mad,10,16
"Look, maybe we should go?",Chandler,Scared,10,17
"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",Rachel,Mad,10,18
"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",Ross,Scared,10,19
"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",Rachel,Sad,10,20
"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",Ross,Peaceful,10,21
"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!",Rachel,Sad,10,22
"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",Ross,Peaceful,10,23
"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",Rachel,Scared,10,24
"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.",Joey,Scared,10,25
"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",Monica,Neutral,11,1
Doesn't matter.,Mr.,Neutral,11,2
What?,Monica,Scared,11,3
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,Mr.,Sad,11,4
"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",Monica,Sad,11,5
"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?",Mr.,Sad,11,6
"Well, uh, I ate some.",Monica,Scared,11,7
"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?",Mr.,Neutral,11,8
Hello?,Monica,Neutral,12,2
Hi.,Ross,Neutral,12,3
"Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.",Rachel,Peaceful,12,4
"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.",Monica,Neutral,12,5
"Look, can, can you do something for me?",Ross,Scared,12,6
"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?",Monica,Powerful,12,7
"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.",Radio,Powerful,12,8
"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.",Radio,Joyful,12,9
"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",Mr.,Neutral,13,1
"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",Monica,Sad,13,2
"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?",Mr.,Neutral,13,3
Cat hair.,Monica,Sad,13,4
"Oh, sorry.",Mr.,Sad,13,5
"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",Monica,Joyful,2,1
"Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.",Richard,Joyful,2,2
"Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?",Richard,Powerful,2,3
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,Monica,Joyful,2,4
What're you doing?,Richard,Neutral,2,5
Just waiting for you sweetie.,Monica,Joyful,2,6
Are you remaking the bed?,Richard,Neutral,2,7
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",Monica,Sad,2,8
"Then, you're redoing it because...",Richard,Neutral,2,9
"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.",Monica,Sad,2,10
You're pretty much running that risk either way.,Richard,Scared,2,11
"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",Monica,Sad,2,12
"Oh, well that's not so crazy.",Richard,Neutral,2,13
I'm just easing you in.,Monica,Joyful,2,14
"Oh, alright.",Richard,Neutral,2,15
"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",Monica,Peaceful,2,16
"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.",Richard,Peaceful,2,17
"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",Monica,Joyful,2,18
"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",Chandler,Neutral,3,1
But don't you need experience for a job like that?,Joey,Scared,3,2
"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",Chandler,Peaceful,3,3
"Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.",Scott,Joyful,3,4
"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",Chandler,Mad,3,5
No kidding.,Scott,Peaceful,3,6
"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",Joey,Powerful,3,7
Where do you work?,Scott,Neutral,3,8
"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",Joey,Neutral,3,9
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.,Chandler,Neutral,3,10
"Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...",Scott,Joyful,3,11
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?,Joey,Joyful,3,12

"Yeah? Are you sure, really.",Phoebe,Joyful,4,3
"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.",Rachel,Scared,4,4
"I, I, I'm hideous.",Phoebe,Sad,4,5
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.,Monica,Neutral,4,6
Come in.,Phoebe,Neutral,5,1
"Hey baby, I'm back...",Ryan,Peaceful,5,2

What's goin' on?,Ryan,Neutral,5,4
"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",Phoebe,Sad,5,5
Chicken or small?,Ryan,Neutral,5,6
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.,Phoebe,Joyful,5,7
Why aren't you at home in bed?,Ryan,Neutral,5,8
"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",Phoebe,Joyful,5,9
"I'm sorry, I never had 'em.",Ryan,Scared,5,10
"Ohh, ohh.",Phoebe,Scared,5,11
"If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.",Ryan,Powerful,5,12
"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",Phoebe,Mad,5,13
Can I please see your face?,Ryan,Neutral,5,14
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.,Phoebe,Scared,5,15
"Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.",Ryan,Peaceful,5,16
"And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.",Phoebe,Scared,5,17
"Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.",Ryan,Peaceful,5,18
"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",Phoebe,Sad,5,19
"Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.",Ryan,Joyful,5,20
"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",Phoebe,Joyful,5,21
Hey.,Joey,Neutral,6,1

"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",Joey,Joyful,6,7
Weird world. Your kids?,Chandler,Neutral,6,8
I figure my character has kids.,Joey,Neutral,6,9
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,Chandler,Scared,6,10
"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",Joey,Joyful,6,11
"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",Chandler,Peaceful,6,12
"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",Joey,Joyful,6,13
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.,Chandler,Joyful,6,14
You know what makes the itching even worse?,Ryan,Neutral,7,1
That you don't stop talking about it.,Phoebe,Neutral,7,2
Fine.,Ryan,Mad,7,3
"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",Phoebe,Joyful,7,4
What're you doing? Are you scratching?,Ryan,Scared,7,5
"No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",Phoebe,Powerful,7,6
You're scratching. Give me the dice.,Ryan,Powerful,7,7
No.,Phoebe,Powerful,7,8
Give me the dice.,Ryan,Powerful,7,9
"No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.",Phoebe,Powerful,7,10
"We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.",Ryan,Neutral,7,11
"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.",Phoebe,Sad,7,12
No.,Ryan,Powerful,7,13
Give it.,Phoebe,Powerful,7,14
No.,Ryan,Powerful,7,15
"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.",Phoebe,Powerful,7,16
Oh God help me.,Ryan,Scared,7,17
"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",Phoebe,Joyful,7,18
"Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",Rachel,Mad,7,19
"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",Ross,Scared,7,20
"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",Joey,Joyful,8,1
"Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.",Jeannie,Joyful,8,2
"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",Joey,Neutral,8,3
Bye bye Joey.,Jeannie,Neutral,8,4

"Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?",Mr.,Mad,8,8

"I have a family, I'm gonna be here.",Mr.,Peaceful,8,10
"Yeah Bing, what's that about?",Joey,Neutral,8,11
"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",Chandler,Powerful,8,12
Rough numbers?,Mr.,Mad,8,13
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,Joey,Neutral,8,14
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.,Mr.,Powerful,8,15
"Uh, if you say so sir.",Chandler,Neutral,8,16
"Joseph's good, isn't he?",Joey,Joyful,8,17
"Well, I'm going to kill you.",Chandler,Mad,8,18
"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",Joey,Joyful,8,19
Why?,Chandler,Neutral,8,20
"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",Joey,Powerful,8,21
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,Joey,Neutral,10,1
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,Chandler,Scared,10,2
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,Joey,Powerful,10,3
"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",Chandler,Scared,10,4
"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",Joey,Neutral,10,5
"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",Chandler,Powerful,10,6
"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",Joey,Neutral,10,7
"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",Chandler,Mad,10,8
"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",Joey,Neutral,10,9
"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",Chandler,Mad,10,10
Karen.,Joey,Neutral,10,11
"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",Chandler,Powerful,10,12
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,Joey,Sad,10,13
"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",Chandler,Powerful,10,14
Really?,Joey,Scared,10,15
"No freakshow, she's fictional.",Chandler,Mad,10,16
"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",Joey,Neutral,10,17
Thank you.,Chandler,Peaceful,10,18
"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.",Joey,Powerful,10,19
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.,Phoebe,Sad,11,1
"No sorry hon, Monica's orders.",Rachel,Neutral,11,2
Well that wasn't easy.,Ryan,Neutral,11,3
"Ok, dinner's on.",Ross,Neutral,11,4

"Alright you kids, bye now.",Ross,Neutral,11,6

No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.,Monica,Mad,12,6
Or so I would have you believe.,Richard,Neutral,12,7
"No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.",Monica,Peaceful,12,8
"Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.",Richard,Mad,12,9
"Alright, go on.",Monica,Neutral,12,10
"Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.",Richard,Neutral,12,11
"Oh my God, you're a freak.",Monica,Joyful,12,12

"So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.",Ross,Peaceful,1,8
"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.",Phoebe,Scared,1,9
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,Chandler,Joyful,1,10
Why? Why can't you go to him?,Ross,Scared,1,11
"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",Phoebe,Scared,1,12
"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.",Chandler,Scared,1,13
"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",Rachel,Scared,1,14
"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.",Phoebe,Scared,1,15
And all these people actually died?,Rachel,Scared,1,16

"What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?",Ross,Scared,2,11
"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.",Joey,Scared,2,12

"It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.",Joey,Mad,2,14
"Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.",Phoebe,Mad,2,15
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.,Joey,Mad,3,1

"Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.",Ross,Mad,3,5
"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",Monica,Peaceful,3,6
"Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.",Ross,Powerful,3,7
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?,Rachel,Scared,3,8

That's what you say at the end of a date.,Chandler,Peaceful,8,17
"You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'",Rachel,Mad,8,18
"To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.",Chandler,Peaceful,8,19

"Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!",Rachel,Scared,10,5
"Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'",Chandler,Mad,10,6

Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,Chandler,Mad,10,8
"I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",Rachel,Mad,10,9

"I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.",Chandler,Scared,14,21
"Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.",Joanna,Sad,14,22

And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",Monica,Powerful,3,22
